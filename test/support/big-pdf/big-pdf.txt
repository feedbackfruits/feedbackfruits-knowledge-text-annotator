EMABM is one of the most important meeting series which brings academicians, students, engineers, geoscientists and industry professionals together in order to share the latest developments and results in the field of building materials characterization. EMABM covers all traditional and modern materials characterization techniques while special emphasis is given on microscopy. The Euroseminar community celebrates its 15 th biennial meeting in the city of Delft, The Netherlands. The local organizing committee is pleased to host the Euroseminar for the second time in Delft, after the successful event in 1999. Furthermore, microscopy is Delft’s historic heritage as it is one of the cradle cities of microscopy and the home town of Anthony van Leeuwenhoek; the pioneer of microscopy in the 17 th century. The technical program and the proceedings comprise 46 peer-reviewed papers which were grouped in 8 sessions on various aspects of building materials microscopy and characterization. Herewith, I acknowledge the members of the scientific committee and the international board of reviewers for their effort and contributions to ensure high level of scientific quality for the event. One of the highlights of the 15 th EMABM is the 1 st EMABM Photomicrography Competition. Participants were invited to submit their best optical and/or electron photomicrographs to the competition. Our aim with this competition is to promote the importance of high quality photomicrography in the field of building materials characterization. The winner is chosen by the votes of the delegates during the Euroseminar. On behalf of the 15 th EMABM local organization committee I would like to acknowledge our sponsors BAS Research and Technology, Phenom World and Pelcon APs for their financial support and technical contributions. A special thanks go to Paul Stutzman (NIST) for giving the opening lecture on quantitative microscopy, to Peter Laugesen (Pelcon APs) for the workshop on concrete petrography, and to Isabel Fernandes (ULISBOA) and Maarten Broekmans (NGO) for the workshop on alkali-reactive aggregate characterization. Finally, all authors and delegates are gratefully acknowledged for being part of the 15 th EMABM. I am confident that the works presented in this proceedings book will serve the building materials microscopy community by generating inspirations for further research, as well as by becoming a useful resource for students and professionals who would like to gain deeper understanding of microscopy related techniques applied to building materials.

Our developing understanding of the phase composition of clinker coincides from the early days of the polarized light microscope, used to resolve conflicting theories on the phase constituents of cement clinker. The phase abundance, distribution and texture of cement clinker reflect the combination of proportioning, grinding, and homogenization of the raw materials, and the firing and cooling history of the clinkering process. The ability to visualize, record and quantify phase compositional and textural attributes of the clinker allowed cement chemists a view into this process, to develop a better understanding of clinker production, and to be able to identify problems in the preparation and firing of the raw materials for improved production of the clinker. Today, we use polished sections of clinker, reflected light microscopy, and quantitative methods that range from linear traverse, point-count analysis, and full-field image processing and analysis. The development of certified clinker reference materials have facilitated the development of standard test methods for clinker microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction, which have provided a means to assess the precision of these methodologies. The application of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) allows analysis of the fine-grained, multi-phase particles of hydraulic cements and pozzolans, expanding our capabilities in mineralogical and textural characterization. Cement phase mineralogy and textural characteristics, captured through SEM imaging, and particle shape characteristics quantified through X-ray tomography has allowed the generation of 3-dimensional virtual cement particles that retain the phase and textural attributes, providing realistic inputs to cement hydration models.

Introduction Portland cement was beginning to replace dimen- sion stone as a principal construction material by the late 19th century because of its relative ease of use, its ability to be cast at the construction site, and its ability to harden when placed under water. The first use of hydraulic cement is attributed to an En- glish engineer, John Smeaton, for the reconstruction of the Eddystone Lighthouse at Cornwall England in 1759 (Bogue, 1955). Up to that time, slaked lime mortars were commonly used but their low dura- bility and lack of integrity under water precluded their use for many applications. Smeaton found, contrary to the conventional wisdom, that softer, im- pure limestone produced superior cement. He also utilized natural pozzolanic tuff, which reacted with the alkaline cement pore solution in his concrete mixtures. The term portland cement was used by Joseph Aspdin, who patented a high-temperature cement manufacturing process, naming the product after Portland limestone, a popular dimension stone used in construction at that time (Bogue, 1955). While use of portland cement increased, little was known about its compositional attributes and Figure 1: An early thin section micrograph (1917) of belite crystals bounded by dark-appearing tricalcium aluminate (90x, crossed Nichols) (Bates and Klein, 1917) how they affected the performance of cement. The popular conception of cement and concrete manu- facture at the time was that the firing process ex- pels air and water from the limestone, and mixing with water reconstitutes it after placement (Bogue, 1955). The introduction of the light microscope pro- 13 Stutzman vided new insight into cement and the hydration products in hardened cement concrete. Henri Le Chatelier made one of the first applications of the petrographic microscope in clinker analysis in the late 1880’s where descriptions of the constituents were made along with sketches of the crystals from thin sections, documenting the optical properties of the main phases and identifying tricalcium sili- cate as the principal constituent (Le Chatelier, 1905). Subsequent work by A.E. Törnebohm and Bates and Klein (Figure 1) provided a more detailed de- scription and naming of the phases and textures of clinker (Insley and Fréchette, 1955). Microscopic examination is a direct means of analysis, in contrast to the indirect Bogue calcula- tions that transform a bulk chemical analysis into phase estimates. While quantitative microscopy is an ideal technique for clinker analysis in cement manufacturing, it is not widely used today due to the time involved in a proper analysis. It does remain very useful as a rapid screening tool to eval- uate clinker production through semi-quantitative assessment of microstructural features and their association with potential processing conditions. The petrographic microscope was instrumental in resolving early cement soundness problems by es- tablishing a link with mineral constituents such as free lime and periclase (Campbell, 1999). Quanti- tative microscopy of clinkers, combined with the long-time study of many cements’ performance provided the basis for phase-related limits in the developing codes and specifications (Brown, 1948). Being able to characterize the mineral and textural characteristics of cementitious materials remains a challenge, but presents opportunities to assess production quality and develop performance pre- dictive models. Quantitative microscopy began with Delesse (1866) recognizing the relationship between the area fraction and volume fraction. The first quantita- tive procedures involved patiently sketching the microstructure on paper, then tracing the grain outlines onto a metal foil, and finally cutting and weighing the mineral constituents represented by the foil traces. The Glagolev-Chayes method, re- ferred to as the point count method, is perhaps the most widely used technique in quantitative mineralogical analysis when using a microscope (Chayes 1956, Campbell and Galehouse, 1991). This methodology was adopted in ASTM C1356, "Stan- dard Test Method for Quantitative Determination of Phases in Portland Cement Clinker by Micro- scopical Point-Count Procedure" (ASTM C1356). More recently, image analysis systems have been used to process and analyze images to quantify microstructural features, bringing quantitative mi- croscopy back to its origin when the microstruc- ture was sketched, traced, cut and weighed. The 14 challenge is in getting the machine to "see" what the microscopist sees, particularly when the differ- ences between constituents are based upon varia- tions in color or texture. In principal, the mineral constituents are being digitally traced and extracted from the bulk microstructure by a set of operations termed image processing. Image analysis, or mea- surement, replaces the weighing operation by pixel counting. The potential for automation of data col- lection and processing promises to provide for a much greater sampling of any microstructure and establishing estimates of microstructural features not easily accomplished in the past. Both light and electron microscopes have been invaluable in developing Standard Reference Mate- rials for cement clinker and to capture the composi- tional and textural aspects of hydraulic cements, fly ash, and slag. In addition to materials characteriza- tion, these data are used in three dimensional mi- crostructure development models of the hydration process. The methods for specimen preparation, microscopy, image processing and analysis will be described using an example from the development of the SRM 2686a clinker. II. Specimen preparation for microscopy A number of sources of systematic and random error are present in any quantitative analyses, influ- enced by sampling, sample preparation, and spec- imen polishing, and operator experience in point counting and phase identification. Obtaining a rep- resentative sample can be a challenge in a cement Figure 2: Reflected light microscope image of a clinker surface after 600-grit silicon carbide grinding (1) ex- hibits no discernible microstructure due to the rough surface. Increased polishing time (2,3,4) using 9 or 6 µm diamond paste removes grinding damage pitting, revealing the underlying microstructural features. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 3: SRM 2686a exhibits a heterogeneous silicate distribution and a fine-grained, differentiated matrix. plant given the throughput of a few hundred tons per hour, or more. Often the objective of the study is to specifically analyze materials that are unusual, like fragments of material dissimilar to the clinker. Proper specimen preparation methods facilitate ex- amination and interpretation of microstructural fea- tures. Improper preparation methods may obscure features, and even create artifacts that may be eas- ily misinterpreted. Reflected light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy using backscattered electron and X-ray imaging require a highly pol- ished surface. The polished surface has two distinct advantages to a fracture surface: 1) clear definition of the constituent phases, and 2) a planar surface amenable for quantitative analysis. Using a repre- sentative sample, specimens are potted in an epoxy resin to permeate the material’s pore system and to encapsulate the particles. Epoxy impregnation of the pore system serves two purposes: A) it fills the voids and encapsulates the particles, creating a solid that is better able to resist plucking and spalling during the polishing process, and B) it en- hances contrast between the pores and cementitious material. With relatively high permeability materi- als or powders such as clinker or portland cement, an epoxy of low viscosity is suitable. The selec- tion of epoxy depends upon the materials and the means for analysis. For polished sections, the ideal epoxy will exhibit good capillarity, wet and bond to pore walls and edges, fill voids, and will not leave any residue on the specimen surface that will adversely affect etching (for light microscopy) or backscattered electron contrast, will not soften (pro- motes particle plucking) from exposure to cleaning agents such as ethanol or acetone and, for SEM analyses, is relatively beam-stable. For clinker, a Table 1: Common phases in ordinary portland cement clinker, blast furnace slag, and fly ash, ordered per material with decreasing brightness in SEM-BE imaging, with average atomic number Z̄ and backscattered electron coefficient h based upon ideal compositions.

Vac- uum assist pulls the air out of the less accessible void spaces and forces the epoxy into these voids. While complete permeation may not be possible in many cases as a result of occluded voids, an additional step of back filling the open voids and a second epoxy cure after sectioning may prove useful. A higher-viscosity epoxy is used for ce- ment, fly ash, and slag powders. This epoxy cures harder and is a better match to the material when polishing. The specimens are then cut or ground to expose a fresh cross section of particles, lapped to smooth the surface, and then polished using 1 Certain commercial materials and equipment are identified in order to adequately specify experimental procedures. In no case does such identification imply recommendation or endorse- ment by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor does it imply that the items are necessarily the best available for the purpose. 2 L.R.

This polishing stage may be subdivided into a coarse polish where the grinding damage is removed to expose a blemish-free cross section, and a fine-polishing stage that removes the fine scratches that obscure the details of the microstruc- ture. Polishing removes the damage imparted by the grinding operations. Using a sequence of suc- cessively finer polishing pastes composed of fine diamond particles (ranging from 15 µm down to 0.25 µm) and a lap wheel covered with a low-relief polishing cloth, an undisturbed microstructure is exposed and the fine scratches of the polishing op- eration are removed. The coarse polishing stage eliminates the grinding damage zone, exposing a relatively undamaged cross section, and the fi- nal polishing removes residual scratches from the coarse polishing stage, ideally leaving a damaged zone that is essentially invisible for the imaging method applied. Figure 2 illustrates the increased clarity of a clinker microstructure as the grinding damage is progressively removed with initial pol- ishing stages using a 1200 grit silicon carbide paper or 9 µm diamond paste. Only when this stage be- gins to cut the topographically high portions off the specimen are the cross sections of the crystals seen. Continued polishing produces a specimen with a minor grinding damage, evidenced by the elongated, irregular-edged dark voids within the clinker crystals. Additional coarse polishing time spent removes most of the grinding damage. Final polishing stages of 3 µm, 1 µm, and 0.25 µm pastes remove fine scratches from the 6 µm polish, fur- ther improving constituent definition. A thorough cleaning is necessary to provide a surface that will allow a uniform etch or carbon coating (for SEM examination). The final polish must meet a number of criteria to ensure one achieves the best possible surface for analysis: • Few scratches on the specimen surface, • Sharp particle and pore perimeter edges (over- polishing will tend to round corners), • Well-defined phases and crystal boundaries, • Minimal surface relief, • No etching due to the polishing process, • Epoxy completely fills all voids, • No polishing media residue trapped within voids or on the surface, and • The surface is cleaned using ethanol or iso- propyl, followed by an acetone rinse. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 5: Backscattered electron (BE) and X-ray image set for SRM 2686a that will be used to segment the sample into the constituent phases. III. Microscopy in the development of a standard reference material clinker The Standard Reference Material (SRM) clinkers are used for developing and testing methods of quantitative phase analysis (Stutzman and Leigh, 2002, Stutzman et al., 2008). These clinkers were selected as representative of the range of North American clinker production with respect to phase abundance, crystal size, and crystal distribution. The reference values represent consensus means and uncertainties based upon two independent an- alytical methods: (1) quantitative XRD, (2) light microscope point counts, and image analysis of scanning electron microscope images. Clinker 2686a is intermediate in crystal size rel- ative to the other SRM clinkers, and exhibits het- erogeneous phase distribution and little free lime (Figure 3). Alite occurs as subhedral to anhedral crystals approximately 30 µm in size. Belite occurs in large clusters with an approximate crystal size of 20 µm. The matrix is differentiated with a medium- to fine-grained lath-like ferrite, and fine-grained aluminate filling the inter-lath voids. Equant peri- clase crystals up to 15 µm are common throughout the microstructure and the alkali sulfate phases aph- thitolite and arcanite are disseminated throughout the microstructure. The scanning electron microscope provides sets of images that are suitable for processing and anal- ysis. The uniformity of the backscattered electron and X-ray images makes it possible to perform image processing (feature extraction) and analysis (measurements) for quantitative microscopy. SEM analysis is perhaps the only microscopic means to characterize fine-grained, multi-phase particles like cement, fly ash, and slag as grinding destroys the crystal arrangements that are so useful for phase identification. Light microscopy is of limited use because of the fine particle size and the potential of etching to partially or completely dissolve the finer-sized particles. The multiple SEM phase and chemical imaging modes help overcome these limi- tations for qualitative and quantitative microscopy (Bullard, et al. 2011, Stutzman et al. 2008, Stutzman 2007, Bentz and Stutzman 1994, Stutzman 1994, and Scrivener, 1987). SEM backscattered electron (BE) and X-ray (XR) images are captured simultaneously and registered (same field of view), presenting different perspec- tives (phase and chemistry) that will be used in conjunction with fabric characteristics (framework, matrix, or dispersed phase) to identify and quan- tify the constituent phases. For the BE image, local brightness is proportional to the individual phase average atomic number (Z̄). The backscatter coeffi- cient h is a measure of the backscattered electron fraction and, following Goldstein et al. (2003), is estimated using the mass fractions and h values for each constituent. Table 1 lists phases that are found in clinker, cement, and pozzolanic mineral additions in descending order of their backscat- tered coefficient and gray intensity. The contrast between alite (Z̄=15.06) and belite (Z̄=14.56) is rel- atively strong and their distinction is clear, while that between belite and cubic aluminate (Z̄=14.34) is generally too weak to distinguish these constituents. Figure 6: Selection of typical regions for each phase establishes the training set for classification. Field width = 750 µm. 17 Stutzman Figure 7: The addition of the Al and Mg images to the BE image (left) and S (right) illustrates the phase distinction provided by the addition of the X-ray image data. Field width = 250 µm. These values are only estimates, but are useful in ranking relative brightness for identification. The actual backscattered coefficient of a phase will de- pend upon chemical substitution and the image col- lection dwell time. Longer image collection times may improve the distinction between phases. Typical SEM operating conditions for cementi- tious materials are between 10 kV and 12 kV accel- erating voltage, about 3 nA probe current, which is adjusted to maximize count rates while keeping a reasonable X-ray dead time, a 5 min. per frame scan rate (1024 x 768 pixels) to minimize image noise, and a total scan time of about 1 h. The magnifi- cation is adjusted to retain a 0.75 µm/pixel spatial resolution. Changes in the accelerating voltage af- fect both the size of the interaction volume, and as such, the spatial resolution, and it affects the X-ray spectral response. Practically, compromises are necessary and the 10kV to 12 kV range rep- resents values that provides a reasonable spatial resolution, improved X-ray response for the lighter elements (Na, Mg, Al), and yet is sufficient to ex- cite the heavier elements (Fe). The X-ray spectrum consists of the characteristic lines for each element present, represented by peaks on the spectrum, and a background of white radiation. X-ray microanaly- sis may be used to identify and quantify chemical composition of phases and can be used to generate images of element spatial distribution. XR imaging is necessary for distinguishing between phases that have the same BE coefficient yet are composition- ally distinct and for identification of phases that are not easily detected in the BE image; periclase and some alkali sulfates will appear dark, like voids. Combining the XR and BE images allows a degree of phase discrimination that is not available from any single image (Table 2). An example of the backscattered electron image and X-ray spectrum for aluminate from SRM 2686a is provided in Figure 4. While the SEM images lack 18 the color information of the light microscope im- ages, the view is not unfamiliar to the microscopist, and is perhaps easier to view and understand due to the uniformity of appearance for each phase, the flexibility with the wide range of magnifica- tion, and the ancillary information provided by X-ray microanalysis. As with the light microscope, identification is made by a combination of phase morphology, association with other constituents (framework grain or matrix phase), BE brightness, and chemistry. For this clinker field of view, there is abundant alite, minor belite, a differentiated ma- trix with abundant ferrite and little aluminate, dis- persed periclase, a cluster of free lime, and some alkali sulfate along void and fracture walls. IV. Scanning electron microscopy analysis While the traditional point count analysis is readily accomplished using a SEM, image processing and analysis using the full image field is common and is amenable to automation in both data collection and analysis, essentially replicating the early days of microscopy employing sketches of the fields of view to quantify phase fractions (Insley and Fréchette, 1955). A BE and X-ray image set from SRM clinker 2686a is presented in Figure 5, with the backscattered elec- tron image labeled BE, and the X-ray images labeled by their respective elements. Image analysis will use a subset of these images to reduce redundancies that can confound the mineral phase segmentation process. An example of redundancy is between the BE and Fe image. Ferrite is the second brightest (Table 1) phase and exhibits a unique grey level. The Fe image duplicates this with an image with inherently greater noise. The use of the Fe image for cements will not add any new information, and may confound the analysis due to the additional 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 8: Original BE Image (left) and segmented, color-coded, indexed image (right). Field width = 250 µm. noise. Principal X-ray images for clinker and cements include Ca, Si, Al, Mg, Fe, K, Na, and O. A visual assessment is usually all that is needed to identify significant images to extract the set of phases. An example may be seen with aluminate and belite having distinct chemical compositions, yet exhibit a similar backscattered electron coefficient. How- ever, belite contains appreciable Si while aluminate contains Al, so use of one or the other of the X- ray images will serve to distinguish these phases. Similarly, the calcium sulfate addition (for cement) and the alkali sulfates are usually difficult to see given the high brightness and contrast of the BE image. The X-ray images Ca, S, K, and Na may be used to aid in their distinction. The mineral phase identification process may be visualized through a process whereby the BE and XR images are merged into a red-green-blue composite image. A useful combination for cement color composites is BE = red, Mg = green and Al = blue to see the belite – aluminate distinction, limestone, and the contri- bution of Mg in identification of periclase. In this case, the addition of the aluminum image makes the aluminate appears purple compared to the dark red of the belite, allowing their distinction. Another useful combination is BE= red, K=green and S=blue to highlight the locations of the gypsum addition to the cement, and alkali sulfates within and along cement grains. Processing the image set serves to enhance the distinction between the constituent phases by re- ducing noise and unwanted signals. This may be accomplished, as needed, by use of a median filter to reduce noise yet retain edge definition, followed by background subtraction to eliminate noise intro- duced by the continuous background of the X-ray spectrum. If difficulties are encountered in subse- quent processing, the median filtered image may be useful in achieving a more successful segmentation. All these operations may be interactively applied using most image analysis codes, and are illustrated here using ImageJ 3 . Traditional image processing methods use Boolean logic and mathematical op- erators to threshold phases individually using one or more images from a set. These operations create binary images for each phase that are subsequently merged into a composite image indexed by phase. While this approach works well, it is tedious since constituents are segmented individually and then merged into a final image. Difficulties in reconcil- ing the composite image are encountered with this 3 ImageJ processing and analysis code: National Institutes of Health, http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html Table 2: Criteria for Phase Identification Using SEM BE and XR imaging Phase Free lime Ferrite Aluminate Belite Periclase Alkali sulfate Gypsum Quartz Slag Backscattered Electron, X-Ray, and textural characteristics High BE, strong Ca, rounded grains High BE, high Fe, prismatic matrix phase Intermediate BE, matrix phase, high Al, low Mg Intermediate BE, rounded grains, low Al Low BE, equant to dendritic habit, may occur anywhere, high Mg Intermediate BE, along grain and void boundaries, high S, high K, medium Na Low BE, high S, high Ca, low K Intermediate BE, high Si Intermediate BE, angular grains, high Si, Mg, and Al 19 Stutzman Figure 9: The box plot provides a graphical comparison of the XRD and microscopy results through assessment of the alignment or mis-alignment of median values and differences in interquartile ranges. process as areas of overlapping phase assignments and holes from incomplete segmentations will need to be resolved. In certain circumstances, however, it can be a rapid and useful means to isolate specific features for quantitative analysis. Multi-spectral processing developed for analyzing hyperspectral remote sensing data provides an alternative method for image processing. (Van Niekerk 2003 and Lydon 2005) applied this approach for geological studies of rocks (Landgrebe, 2003, Landgrebe and Biehl, 2011). Combinations of BE and XR images of cementi- tious materials are displayed to identify the con- stituent phases, to establish a user-defined training set of image regions typical of each phase (includ- ing voids), and to classify each pixel into the phase group to which it most likely belongs. The suit- ability of the classifier and the operator-designated training set in segmentation may be assessed by a visual evaluation of the resulting segmented im- age and by evaluation of the accuracy in which the training set was properly classified. Multi-spectral processing begins with reading the subset of BE Figure 10: Segmentation of a polished section of hydraulic cement, following the same techniques used for clinkers, resulting in a segmented, indexed image.

Different combinations are displayed for phase identification and establishing the user-defined training set (Figure 6). By merging individual images into a red-green-blue channel pseudo-colored image, the constituent phases may be highlighted and identified (Figure 7). Regions of each phase (including void space) are defined with a training set, with at least 100 pixels each to define each phase. The next step is to select a classifier and group like pixels and review the per- formance of that classifier on the training set. The classifier extrapolates the training set characteristics for each phase for the entire image to complete the classification. V. Image processing Reviewing the performance of the classifier on the designated training field pixels provides an initial sense of the success of the segmentation (Table 3) where a successful classification has high reference accuracies for each phase. The miss-classifications in the matrix to the right provides clues to the na- ture of any miss-classifications. The addition of a larger number of training pixels often will reduce the classification error through an improved def- inition of the range of class attributes. The best assessment of the segmentation will be a compar- ison of the segmented image to the original BE image. Figure 8 shows the original BE and a color- coded, segmented image. The resulting image is typically displays each phase uniquely identified by a color and an index value. Since clinker is a heterogeneous product, replicate data on different arbitrarily selected fields of view are required to allow an estimate of the uncertainty (Table 4). VI. Comparison to quantitative X-ray powder diffraction measurements Box plots provide a useful comparison between the independent data sets from SEM (n = 20) and XRD (n = 33) for clinker composition. The width of each box is proportional to sample size, the interquartile range ("middle half") of the data are represented by the body of the box, the median value is marked by the X within the box, the extremes are represented by the ends of the straight lines projecting out of the box, and circles outside the extremes of each box represent outliers. Recognizing that each method has a set of unique biases, results for each method Table 4: Phase abundance results from SEM / image analyses on n=20 specimens, expressed as mass fractions.

The microscopy appears to slightly over-estimate the silicates relative to the XRD. Certified values (Ta- ble 4) represent a consensus between these unique methods by quantifying and including in the over- all estimate of uncertainty the systematic biases of the individual methods by using the variation across the methods’ results. VII. Application to cements, fly ash, and slag The SEM provides the means to quantitatively de- scribe fine-grained multi-phase powders in a way not possible using light microscopy. Imaging ce- ments, fly ash, slag and other supplementary ce- mentitious materials poses a more complicated problem with material preparation, image inter- pretation and analysis. Additional phases, such as calcium sulfates, and pozzolanic additions, such as limestone, fly ash, or slag, must be considered. Figure 10 shows the original BE image of a pol- ished cement section and the resulting segmented image. From the segmented, indexed image, mea- surements of area fraction, surface perimeter frac- tion, and spatial distribution may be made for the constituent phases (Bentz, et al. 1999, Bullard et al., 2011). Taking these data and combining them with X-ray computed tomography images of real cement particles has enabled the generation of vir- tual cement particles (Figure 11) with the phase and textural characteristics of actual industrial cements, which has been invaluable in the development of virtual cement hydration models (Bullard et al., 2011). SEM BE and XR images of fly ash and slag are shown in Figures 12 and 13. Fly ash is a com- plex mixture predominantly of glassy phases and some crystalline constituents (Chancy et al. 2010). If sufficiently coarse, the mineral constituents can be imaged and measured. The most common min- eral, quartz, may be seen in Figure 11 as regions of high Si, intermediate BE, and lacking signal in any of the other X-ray images. The slag in Figure 12 is almost all glass, however subtle differences in the X-ray images reflect two slightly different glass compositions. VIII. Summary Microscopy has played a significant role in devel- oping our understanding of cementitious materials compositions and their effects on cement and con- crete performance. It continues to play an impor- tant role in the evaluation of cement clinker kiln operations and as a quantitative tool for assessing phase compositions. Point-counting for quantita- tive phase abundance is a mature method, yet is one of the few direct methods to determine clinker Figure 12: SEM BEI (left) and X-Ray image of SRM 2691 fly ash composed of combined images of Ca (red), Si (green), Al (blue), and Mg (gray) illustrates its chemical and compositional complexity.

The application of the scan- ning electron microscope with X-ray microanalysis complements light microscopy by not only provid- ing analyses of clinker, but also of the more difficult fine-grained powders of portland cement and poz- zolans like fly ash, and slag. While these images may also be point-counted, image processing and analysis provides a means for full-field quantita- tive measurements on area fraction and surface perimeter fraction, and spatial distribution for the constituent phases. These data, coupled with X-ray computed tomography, are providing the means to generate three-dimensional particles that cap- ture the characteristics of phase abundance and texture and are invaluable in the development of three-dimensional computer simulation models of cement hydration.

Microscopy is a powerful technique as it can follow the production process from the quarry, through the milling and finally the clinker formation stages. It is essentially a historical record of the link between the raw materials entering the kiln, the actual process conditions in the kiln and the final product, the clinker. For the optimum clinkering process to take place, both chemical and mineralogical parameters need to be satisfied. Burnability is the term commonly used to describe this measurement and calculates the amount of theoretical free lime remaining in the clinker. It is here where the microscope is used with great effect to determine the characteristics of the raw meal. Transmitted light microscopy is used mainly for diagnostic purposes on the raw materials and the kiln feed although can be used to examine the clinker, but this is usually limited to specialist applications. Reflected light microscopy is used mainly for clinker examination, which is carried out on an epoxy impregnated sample of clinker treated with various stains and etches to enhance the clinker phases (alite, belite, aluminate, ferrite and periclase). The microscopic evaluation of these phases (size, distribution and morphology) indicates the process conditions in the kiln. Changes are made in the preparation of the raw meal (chemical and mineralogical) and process conditions (flame shape, kiln speed/feed, temperature profile) to optimize the clinker formation. Keywords: microscopy, raw materials, clinker microstructures, process conditions I. Introduction Microscopy of clinker can be traced back as far as 1887 with the work done by Le Chatelier (Camp- bell, 1999), based on earlier examination of rocks by the English geologist H.C. Sorby. The naming of the clinker mineral phases can be attributed to Törnebohm in 1897. Today both transmitted and re- flected light are used to explain the features of pow- der mounts and polished sections of raw mateials and clinker. Figure 1 shows a typical transmit- ted/reflected light microscope which is used for the examination of both powder mounts and pol- ished sections. II. Transmitted light microscopy The transmitted light microscope is used mainly for the examination of raw materials used in the preparation of the raw meal and kiln feed. Materi- als examined include thin-sections of rocks (petro- graphic examination), powder mounts of the raw mill product or kiln feed and powder mounts of clinker. Figure 1: A typical microscope used for both transmitted and reflected light examination. 25 du Toit & Caragacean Figure 2: Transmitted light image of a limestone contain- ing calcite fossil shells. Petrographic examination – transmitted light A petrographic analysis of the rock types used in clinker manufacture (e.g. limestone) will reveal the suitability or not of these rock types for clinker prodution. The major component for clinker man- ufacture is the limestone which occurs in several different forms. Pure limestone is best suited to the process and typically contains more than 85% CaCO 3 . Figure 2 shows a transmitted light image (Campbell, 1999) of a thin-section of limestone used in the manufacturing process. It is possible to use ‘impure limestone’ for clinker production but then the following mineral phases need to be taken in account when designing a raw mix for the cement plant. Pyrite is found in many limestones and will form SO 2 once in contact with the hot gasses and lead to emissions from the stack. Authigenic quartz crys- tals which are found as rims around calcite grains can lead to difficult grinding in the raw mills and result in quartz grains which cannot be ground fine enough and therefore influence the chemical reac- tions in the kiln. Dolomite contains MgO which forms periclase in the clinker and may cause expan- sion in the concrete after several years. Argillaceous limestones contain varying amounts of clay and silt which need to be carefully controlled if used as constituents in the process – the amount of alu- mina and iron need to be balanced in the raw mix composition. Flint and chert (impure crypto-crystalline silica) as shown in Figure 3 (Campbell, 1999), are found as concretionary minerals mainly in chalk deposits and need to be separated before the chalk can be used in the manufacturing process. Powder mount examination – transmitted light The transmitted light microscope is also used to examine powders. The main application is the ex- 26 Figure 3: Thin-section showing chert particle in raw meal. amination of the raw mill product (raw meal) and in particular specific size fractions of limestone and quartz. The production of raw meal must conform to both chemical and physical constraints: chemical properties with respect to the accurate proportion- ing of raw materials to give the desired phase com- position in the clinker (C 3 S, C 2 S, C 3 A & C 4 AF); and physical properties with respect to the fineness so that the minerals have sufficient time to transform in the kiln burning process. Thermodynamically, there is a limited amount of time for these minerals to react to form the clinker phases and if they are particularly large, the clinker minerals will be unable to form in the correct pro- portions. A large amount of the limestone particles (CaCO 3 ) greater than 125µm will lead to Free CaO in the clinker resulting in irregular setting time of cement. On the other hand, a large amount of quartz particles greater than 45µm will result in excess C 2 S (belite) and insufficient C 3 S (alite), low- ering the clinker reactivity. Figure 4 (Campbell, 1999) shows particles of quartz >45µm in the raw meal which will adversely affect the formation of clinker phases during the burning process. Combinability formulas Results from the examination of powder mounts of raw meal are used to determined the combinabil- ity of the meal and has been the subject of many researchers (Miller, 1981; Campbell, 1999; Theisen, 1992; and Hills, 2002, 2004), who have developed methods and formulae to evaluate the ‘theoretical combinability’. The combinability of the raw mix is determined by both chemical and mineralogi- cal factors, principally the Lime Saturation Factor (LSF) and Silica Ratio (SR), and the coarse particles of lime, quartz and other insoluble minerals. The formula of Theisen (1992) is presented below. The 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Clinker powder mount examination – transmit- ted light Figure 4: Powder mount of +45µm acid insoluble residue showing coarse quartz particle. work done by Fundal (1999) shows the relevance of the maximum particle size for calcite and quartz to the burnability function. F CaO ( 1400 C ) = 0.343 ⇥ ( LSF 93 ) + 2.74 ⇥ ( SR 2.3 ) + 0.1 ⇥ ( C + 125µm + 0.83 ⇥ ( Q + 45µm + 0.39 ⇥ ( Aq + 45µm ) ( 1 ) Briefly the raw meal sample is subjected to chem- ical dissolution in 20% HCl and the amount of CaCO 3 and insoluble residue (siliceous and other) is calculated in the 125µm and 45µm size fraction respectively. LSF and SR are determined by tradi- tional XRF analysis. The results are entered into the formula and the Free CaO contribution of each component is calculated. Table 1 gives an example of typical results from the XRF analysis, sieving and chemical dissolution. Table 2 shows the potential Free CaO contribution from each component. It is clearly demonstrated that the higher amount of coarse quartz (7.98% >45µm) in Sample A con- tributes to a higher potential Free CaO (6,63%) in the combinability formula. The industrial burning of this raw mix (Sample A) will lead to a higher fuel consumption and poorer clinker quality. In the last instance, transmitted light can also be used to examine a powder mount of the clinker. The preparation, examination and set-up of the micro- scope are different from the previous two methods. Powders are immersed in a refractive index liquid and the microscope is equipped with a Senarmont compensator and rotating analyzer. The clinker powder sample is also subjected to various chemi- cal treatments to enhance certain phases e.g. treat- ment with KOH-sugar or Salicylic acid/Methanol solutions. The purpose of transmitted light examination of clinker is to determine optical parameters for the interpretation of burning conditions according to the Ono Method (1995). Interpretation of the pro- cess conditions - heating rate (from the alite size), cooling rate (belite colour), maximum temperature (alite birefringence) and burning time (belite size) can be inferred. This technique is usually limited to specialist applications and carried out by expert microscopists. Figure 5 Left image shows the trans- mitted light photo of an alite crystal of the typical size and orientation to measure the birefringence and in the Right image a belite crystal showing a light amber colour (typical of slow cooling). III. Reflected light for clinker microscopy The reflected light mode is used for the examina- tion of polished surfaces of clinker and is the most well established method for examining clinker. Mi- croscopy can be used as a tool to look both into the past and the present - to reflect what has happened and detect reasons for poor clinker quality and thus poor cement strength, or it can be used on-line to improve the process conditions in real time. It is essentially a historical record of the link between the raw materials entering the kiln, the actual pro- cess conditions in the kiln and the final product, the clinker. For on-line control, clinker samples are usually taken every 2-4 hours depending on the prepara- Table 2: Potential Free CaO from each component.

Quick set epoxy resins and high speed polishing equipment is required to get results timeously. For other investigations, a more meticulous rou- tine can be used to prepare highly polished surfaces to examine finer details within the clinker. Standard metallurgical equipment is used to polish the sur- face of the clinker impregnated mount. Polishing media include fine diamond or alumina particles in a suspension. Care must be taken not to use any water based lubricants as the clinker phases will start to react. Once an epoxy mount has been prepared, a num- ber of stains or etches are used to enhance the clinker phases to facilitate the microscopic exami- nation. The clinker phases can be separated into two groups – the silicate phases C 3 S and C 2 S, and the matrix or interstitial phases C 3 A and C 4 AF – each with specific chemical solutions for staining or etching. Additional minor phases which may need to be identified are periclase (MgO), Free CaO and alkali-sulphates. For the etching media, care must be taken to use analytical grade solutions as impuri- ties may introduce artifacts and misinterpretations can be made. A small eye-dropper or pipette is used to cover the surface of the clinker with the so- lution for the required time and then the iso-propyl alcohol is used to wash the etching solution from the surface. A hair-dryer is used to dry the surface before microscopic examination. For the silicate group, the most common etching medium is Nital, a solution of 1,5 ml nitric acid (HNO 3 ) in 100 ml iso-propyl alcohol. Nital reacts quickly (6-10 seconds) with alite and belite. Alite normally turns blue to green and belite blue to brown. Other etching media for the silicates in- clude ammonium chloride, and hydrofluoric acid vapour. The latter is hazardous and contact with the HF liquid or vapour must be avoided. The etched sample needs to stand in a fume cupboard so that excess HF vapour leaves the surface, otherwise the microscope lenses can be damaged. For the aluminate (C 3 A) and Free CaO, a potas- sium hydroxide (0,1 molar aqueous) solution is the most common. After 30 seconds, aluminate turns blue-brown and Free CaO brown. Warm distilled water (40 C for 5-10 seconds) is a good stain to show Free CaO (multi-coloured) without affecting the other phases. The ferrite phase (C 4 AF) is not affected by any of the etching media and remains brightly reflective (white to off-white).

IV. Interpretation of clinker micro-structures The microscopic evaluation of the clinker phases (size, distribution and morphology) indicates the preparation and raw meal and the process con- ditions in the kiln. Changes are made to the preparation (chemical and mineralogical as de- scribed earlier) and to the process (flame shape, kiln speed/feed, temperature profile) to optimize the clinker formation. The micrographs in the fol- lowing section show features which include well prepared raw meal and stable process conditions – and therefore a good clinker phase composition and structure. A good clinker microstructure is char- acterized by well formed hexagonal alite crystals with clean edges (35-45µm in size), well-rounded belite showing smooth (not ragged) edges (15-25µm in size), and a very fine cryto-crystalline matrix of aluminate and ferrite. Further micrographs show some instances where either preparation of raw meal or kiln process condi- tions have not produced clinker of optimum quality. The microstructures seen in the polished specimens give an indication of which changes are necessary to bring the clinker quality back to the required level. There is more than one type of clinker and not all have the same raw meal chemistry, mineralogy, mill-preparation and process conditions. For ex- ample, cement for oil-well applications has specific requirements - usually these have a higher alite content and lower aluminate content. Process con- ditions also have to change to ensure a different phase composition with respect to size of crystals. Typical clinker microstucture The micrographs below show clinker microstruc- tures characteristic of well prepared raw meal and stable process conditions. Figure 6 Left image shows well formed (euhedral) alite crystals, with rounded belite crystals in the left upper corner. Fig- ure 6 Right image shows large euhedral alite and smaller rounded belite in the matrix. Clinker microstructure – alite and belite The micrographs show typical shape and structure of alite and belite.

Figure 7 Left im- age shows alite crystals and Figure 7 Right image shows belite crystals. Clinker microstructure – oil well clinker The manufacture of oil well clinker demands spe- cial raw meal preparation, different chemistry as well as different process conditions in the kiln. The objective is to make the clinker less reactive, there- fore the alite crystals are much larger than normal and the belite should be ‘broken-up’ in the matrix. Overall this raw meal is coarser than normal and requires higher burning temperatures in the kiln to combine the raw meal to the correct clinker phase morphology. Figure 8 Left and Right shows images of the typical microstructure of an oil well clinker. Clinker microstructure – Periclase and calcite par- ticles When the amount of MgO is high (>3%) in the raw meal and there is slow cooling at the end of the kiln, periclase may form as small euhedral crystals in the clinker. Similarly, if there are coarse limestone particles, then residual Free CaO may found in the clinker. Figure 9 Left image shows periclase crys- tals and Right image shows Free CaO clusters. Both these phases may be detrimental to the clinker per- formance. Periclase (MgO) may hydrate to brucite (Mg ( OH ) 2 ) with an expansive force which causes cracking in concrete at later ages. Free CaO may cause plaster popping when it hydrates after addi- tion of water the cement. Clinker microstructure – Slow cooling and belite nesting The material clinkering temperature is around 1450 C in the hottest part of the kiln and after that the clinker moves under the flame and drops into the cooler for further cooling and transport to the storage silo. If the flame shape is not set-up cor- rectly, a ’slow’ cooling zone in the kiln (behind the flame) may result in poor belite formation which is not as reactive in the cement product. A change to a short and sharp flame shape would change the position of the cooling zone in the kiln and improve the belite shape and reactivity. If the raw meal contains a large amount of coarse siliceous parti- cles, then belite nesting will result. The siliceous particles cannot combine with the CaO to form the required amount of alite, resulting in excessive be- lite occurring as nests and clusters in the clinker.

Microstructural inves- tigations yield important information on phase distribution and the conditions of the phase formation. The correct understanding of clinker microstructure is crucial for an accurate evaluation of raw material, fuel or process parame- ters. Two case studies on clinker samples are presented, in which individual granules with unusual microstructure characteristics were observed. In the first case study, the clinker contained a granule the centre of which mainly consisted of belite crystals in direct contact with free lime crystals. Additionally several alite crystals that had partially decomposed to belite and free lime from the rim inwards were observed in the granule centre. EDX measurements, element mapping and the interpretation of the microstructure showed that an accumulation of barium, probably introduced into the kiln as baryte, was the cause of the observed local phenomena. In the second case study, granules with domains containing elemental iron were observed. Additionally these domains contained alite, high amounts of C 3 A, no belite and no C 4 AF. The iron was intergrown with free lime. Estimations based upon the surface area ratio of the phases in the intergrowths show that C 4 AF is probably the compound from which the intergrowths formed after reduction of ferric iron to elemental iron. Keywords: portland cement clinker, microstructure, case study, burning conditions I. Introduction The use of alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR) for the production of Portland cement clinker has gained more and more importance over the last decades and this trend continues. These materials contribute materially to the formation of the clinker phases and help to save fossil fuels and natural raw materials. The use of AFR can influence the clinker properties. Many of the effects can be observed in the clinker microstructure. Therefore clinker microscopy is also gaining im- portance as an analytical method, withstanding the trend to automatable, quantitative methods like X- ray fluorescence (XRF) or X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microscopy can provide information on the phase distribution and the conditions of the phase forma- tion, which are important for the evaluation not only of the effects of AFR, but also of fossil fuels and natural raw materials. The correct understanding of the clinker mi- crostructure is crucial for an accurate evaluation of raw material, fuel or process parameters. This requires extensive experience from the microscopist. Case studies on rare or previously undescribed fea- tures help microscopists to broaden their experience backgound. Selected results of two microscopic investigations on clinker samples are presented here, performed for cement plants for the evaluation of burning conditions, especially for the confirmation of the absence or presence of signs for reducing burning conditions. In the respective clinker samples un- usual microstructural characteristics were observed and interpreted, partly with additional information from scanning electron microscopy. II. Sample preparation and analysis For the examination of the clinker samples with optical microscopy, representative subsamples with a grain size of 2 - 4 mm were obtained by crushing the clinker sample in a jaw crusher and sieving the crushed material. The subsamples were embedded in epoxy resin under vacuum. After curing, polished sections of the embedded samples were produced. The polished sections were etched with a 10% KOH solution as well as an alcoholic dimethyl ammonium citrate (DAC) solution for several seconds, respectively, and then investigated with an optical microscope (Zeiss Axioplan) under reflected light. The etching procedure enables the distinction of the different clinker phases (alite/C 3 S/Ca 3 SiO 5 ; 33 Böhm & Lipus belite/C 2 S/Ca 2 SiO 4 ; C 3 A/Ca 3 Al 2 O 6 ; brownmillerite/C 4 AF/Ca 2 (Al,Fe)O 5 ; free lime/CaO) under the microscope. While the brownmillerite (C 4 AF) is recognizable due to its strong reflectivity without etching, the other three main clinker phases look very similar under reflected light. The KOH solution causes a discolouration of the C 3 A from a light grey to a darker grey or brown. The DAC solution etches the surface of alite crystals which produces an apparent sharp dark line around the crystals. A colour change of alite from light grey to a darker grey or brown is common. Belite is slightly etched structurally and slightly changes its colour from light grey to a darker grey. Additionally to light microscopy, the polished section from case study 1 was analysed with a scanning electron microscope (Philips ESEM XL30 FEG) with the possibility for energy dispersive X- ray (EDX) analysis. EDX analyses were carried out in the form of spot analyses and in the form of element mappings. III. Results of case study 1 In this case study a clinker sample was analysed to estimate the effects of different fuels on the clinker properties. In general the clinker sample was well burned and did not show unusual phases or mi- crostructural features. However, one single clinker granule in the pol- ished section consisted mainly of belite, free lime and ground mass (C 3 A, C 4 AF) with a low amount of alite crystals. The alite crystals were surrounded by a symplectite of belite (belite I in Figures 1 and 2) and fine grained free lime crystals (free lime I in Figures 1 and 2). The free lime crystals were often oriented towards the alite crystals. The symplec- tites formed a layer of up to 20 µm thickness. Many symplectites did not contain cores of alite. Beside these symplectites with and without alite cores, the granule consisted of a mixture of coarse grained belite (belite II in Figures 1 and 2) and free lime crystals (free lime II in Figures 1 and 2). In usual Portland cement clinker the direct con- tact of belite and free lime occurs only as a result of high concentrations of phosphorous (e.g. Puntke, Schneider, 2005), of alite decomposition due to re- ducing burning conditions (VDZ, 1965; Böhm, 2011) or in poorly burned material. Poor burning leads to crystal sizes below 10 µm and high porosity (VDZ, 1965; Campbell, 1999; Böhm, Pierkes, 2009). Both features were not found here. Additionally large alite crystals (Figure 1) prove that the material was exposed to conditions sufficient for alite formation. Phosphorous can stabilise belite, preventing the for- mation of alite and leading to a mixture of coarse grained belite and free lime (Puntke, Schneider, 34 2005; Böhm, Pierkes, 2009). However, symplectites of belite and free lime as they were observed here (Figure 1) usually do not occur in connection with phosphorus. The symplectites of belite and free lime surround- ing alite crystals and the orientation of the elon- gated free lime crystals pointing towards the alite crystals indicate the (partial) breakdown of alite. The symplectites with and without alite cores prob- ably formed as pseudomorphs after alite. The most common cause for the breakdown of alite in mod- ern Portland cement clinker is the occurrence of local reducing conditions in the kiln feed, caused by smouldering particles of AFR. This can lead to symplectites of belite and free lime as in Figure 1. However, reducing conditions do not prevent the formation of alite as indicated by the coarse grained mixture of belite and free lime crystals around the symplectites. To clarify the cause for the formation and subse- quent partial breakdown of alite while at the same time the formation of alite was prevented in the vicinity, the clinker granule was analysed using SEM and EDX analyses. The measurements re- vealed unusually high concentrations of barium in the clinker granule (Table 1). Alite contained less than 2 mass % of barium. The belite crystals in the symplectites (belite I) contained about 7 mass % of barium, whereas the belite crystals mixed with coarse grained free lime (belite II) contained about 10 mass % of barium. The barium distribution be- tween alite and the two populations of belite is also illustrated in the element maps in Figure 2. The different barium contents and the microstruc- tural features lead to the following interpretation. The high barium content in the belite II-crystals prevented the formation of alite and led to a mi- crostructure comparable to that caused by high concentrations of phosphorous. The concentrations of barium in the remaining alite crystals was not high enough to prevent the formation of alite at sintering temperatures or the breakdown of alite to belite and free lime during cooling. However, in some alite crystals the barium concentration was low enough to allow the formation of alite at sin- tering conditions, but high enough to destabilise the crystal structure, leading to its disintegration during cooling and the formation of symplectites of belite I and free lime. This process either led to the breakdown of complete alite crystals or only of the outer rims, indicating zonation in the original alite crystals with increasing barium contents from core to rim. It remains unclear if the inhomogeneous distribu- tion of barium is the consequence of the inhomoge- neous distribution of the element in its source. An- other plausible explanation would be that the alite crystals selectively incorporated lower amounts 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 1: Reflected light micrograph of clinker; alite directly surrounded by a symplectite of free lime crystals often oriented towards alite (free lime I) and belite crystals (belite I), itself surrounded by a mixture of coarse round free lime crystals (free lime II) and belite (belite II); outer rim of symplectite marked with dashed red line. of barium at the beginning of their formation at lower temperatures and increased the incorporated amount in outer zones formed later and therefore at higher temperatures. The observation that zones containing higher barium concentrations disinte- grated during cooling indicates that the amount of barium, which can be integrated into the alite crys- tal structure, increases with increasing temperature. The granule described here was the only one in the polished section showing microstructural fea- tures influenced by barium. The source for barium was therefore an exceptional compound in the raw materials or fuels used. The most probable source is a crystal of baryte (BaSO4), which can be found in the limestone formations used in the cement plant in which the clinker was produced. The average amount of barium in cements is 280 mg/kg. It replaces Ca in all clinker phases ex- cept C 4 AF (Bhatty, 1995). It can decrease the clink- erisation temperature, improve the mineralogical composition and increase cement strength (Bhatty, 1995). However, most studies worked with smaller concentrations of barium than found in the clinker granule described here (e.g. Bhatty, 2006). IV. Results of case study 2 Also in this case study a clinker sample was anal- ysed to estimate the effects of different fuels on the clinker properties. The clinker sample was well burned and mostly did not show unusual phases or microstructural features. However, in some granule fragments in the pol- ished section alite crystals partially decomposed to belite and free lime and/or C 4 AF along crys- tallographic preferred orientations. In some gran- ule fragments alite crystals partially decomposed to symplectites of belite and free lime. Both mi- crostructural features indicate reducing burning conditions (VDZ, 1965; Böhm, Pierkes, 2009; Böhm, Table 1: EDX measurements of the composition of alite, belite I (crystals close to alite and in contact with fine grained free lime), and belite II (crystals remote from alite and in contact with coarse grained free lime).

The decomposition of alite is caused by the incorporation of Fe 2 + ions in the crystal structure of alite. The ions form under reducing conditions in the kiln and they destabilise the crystal structure of alite (e.g. Sylla, 1981). Additionally several clinker granule fragments contained elemental iron particles forming sym- plectites with free lime crystals (Figure 3). These particles also contained alite, partially decomposed to fine grained symplectites of belite and free lime, as well as belite and C 3 A, while C 4 AF was not pre- served. In these clinker particles belite and C 3 A were hard to discern with the etching procedure described above (Figure 3). Iron particles can form under strongly reducing conditions, but they are usually not intergrown with free lime (e.g. Pierkes, Böhm, 2009). The re- 36 curring symplectitic structure of iron and free lime indicates an equally recurring precursor phase con- taining CaO as well as Fe. The symplectites were xenomorph and seem to form, together with the areas consisting of C 3 A and belite, a groundmass in which alite crystals are embedded. Probably C 4 AF was the precursor phase for the symplectites. It must have formed before the ma- terial was exposed to strongly reducing conditions, which led to the conversion of ferric iron in the phase to elemental iron. The aluminium content of C 4 AF was bound in the form of C 3 A, whereas the excess CaO formed free lime intergrowing with the newly formed elemental iron. Estimations based on chemical composition, molar masses and densi- ties result in a CaO/Fe-volume ratio of 0.85, which roughly coincide with the area ratio of free lime and 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 3: Reflected light micrograph of clinker; symplectites of free lime and elemental iron together with alite crystals in a ground mass free of C 4 AF. iron particles in the symplectitic structures (Figure 3). The concerned clinker granules must have been exposed to the reducing conditions after passing the sintering zone, since relatively large C 4 AF crys- tals seem to have been the precursor for the free lime-iron symplectites. However, the temperatures must have been high enough to allow for the re- crystallization of the ground mass. References Bhatty, J.I.

However, accurate qualification and use in concrete are hindered by their inherent heterogeneity and large variability. Current characterization techniques often fail to deliver satisfactory detail, in particular on the dominant amorphous fraction of the fly ash. Furthermore, a lack of appropriate tools to quantify the extent of fly ash reaction in cement leaves many aspects of their reactivity poorly understood. We developed a new approach to characterize fly ash using electron microscopy. EDX element composition of millions of points is plotted in a ternary frequency plot. A quick visual analysis informs the operator of the number, approximate chemical composition and relative proportions of populations that constitute the fly ash. For quantitative characterization of the raw fly ash, these populations are grouped as predominantly: silicate, calcium-silicate, aluminosilicate and calcium-rich aluminosilicate. The technique was further developed to quantify the consumption of these fly ash populations in Portland-fly ash cement during hydration. Two calcareous fly ashes of similar bulk chemical composition by XRF actually contained very different amounts of the populations, which react at different rates. Fly ash 1 contains around 90 vol.-% of moderately-reactive aluminosilicates and calcium-silicates. Overall reaction of fly ash 1 reached 60% at 90 days. Fly ash 2 reacted faster, reaching 60% reaction at 28 days as it contains 55 vol.-% of highly-reactive calcium-rich aluminosilicates. Further reaction was slower as 20 vol.-% of fly ash 2 were non-reactive silica-rich phases. Keywords: composite cement, fly ash, characterization, reactivity, EDX. I. Introduction Calcareous fly ashes derived from coal combustion are high-potential reactive residues for composite cements (Papadakis, 2000). However, these fly ashes are inherently heterogeneous and variable and it is difficult to predict and to control the properties of cements containing them. Characterization and qualification of these ashes is not easy and in con- sequence many are discarded out of hand. Indeed, only about 30 wt.-% of globally available calcareous fly ashes are used for cement and concrete. Calcareous fly ashes are composed of crystalline and amorphous phases, among which the amor- phous phases usually dominate. Indeed, the amor- phous fraction in fly ashes may represent up to around 90 wt.-% of this material. The crystalline phases can be identified by XRD diffraction and quantified with Rietveld refinement. The amor- phous fraction is the main contributor to reactive components. Unfortunately it is not homogeneous but a collection of compositions (Pietersen, 1993). Most of the currently available characterization tech- niques fail to distinguish between the various amor- phous compositions in a fly ash. As a result, bulk chemical information is often the only data read- ily available for characterization. It is frequently reported in studies on fly ashes and even used in standards as a basis to classify the ashes (ASTM 2012; EN 2011). However, any kind of bulk descrip- tion will always lack the necessary detail to describe a complex multi-phase material like fly ash. Electron microscopy EDS can be used to investi- gate chemical composition of glassy particles in fly ash. The EDS data can be collected in point mode (operator chosen or a grid of points) or as map- ping. As the number of points in the point mode is around one to several hundred, the large hetero- geneity of fly ash composition is likely to cause a significant scatter in the results and thus hinder any detailed analysis. With the advent of fast EDS detectors it is now possible to collect a spectrum 39 Durdziński et al. Figure 1: Particle size distributions by laser diffraction. for every pixel of the image frame within an hour (mapping). The spectra are represented in a set of intensity maps, one per element. Such maps can be analyzed with MultiSpec c , a multispectral image analysis software, as presented in (Chancey et al., 2010) or similar. Such software uses an algorithm to identify and quantify groups of mutually exclu- sive compositions. This approach can treat large amount of data but the analysis may be difficult and may require a skilled operator. The main draw- back of using an algorithm is that the operator must specify the number of groups or let the algorithm do it. In both cases the control over the analysis is partially lost. Further, if EDS X-ray count is used as an input and not the more time-consuming cal- culated element amounts in atomic-% or mass-%, the chemical composition of the segmented groups can only be analyzed semi-quantitatively. This is because X-ray counts are not a direct measure of element content. In this study we quantify the spectra in EDS maps using profile fitting and PhiRhoZ matrix cor- rections to obtain maps that contain directly the element content in atomic-%. These results are plotted in a ternary plot with Al, Si and Ca - the dominant elements - in the apexes. A statistically reliable analysis requires millions of data points and this amount quickly saturates a plot of single data points. Our solution is to re-plot the data using a ternary frequency plot. In such plot the dominant compositions appear as color blobs, which allows Table 1: XRF bulk chemical analysis [wt.-%].

These ranges are then used as selection criteria for image analysis and quantification of the populations in the raw ash. Once the raw ash is analyzed, this approach can be used to track the anhydrous populations in a hydrating Portland-fly ash paste. Quantities reported over hydration times serve to analyze the reaction progress of each of the populations indi- vidually. More details on the described procedure can be found in (Durdziński et al., 2015). II. Materials Two calcareous fly ashes (FA1 and FA2) and Port- land cement (PC) were used in this study. Their bulk chemical composition was determined by XRF (Table 1) and their phase composition by XRD- Rietveld refinement (Table 2). These materials were ground to 4200 cm 2 /g Blaine fineness and the re- sulting particle size distributions were measured by laser diffraction using Malvern MasterSizer S as shown in Figure 1. III. Methods Sample preparation For characterization of raw fly ashes, powder fly ash samples were compacted by pressing into pel- lets and embedded in epoxy resin. To study fly ash hydration we prepared blends of 55 wt.-% PC and 45 wt.-% fly ash (PC-FA1 and PC-FA2). These blends were mixed with water at a ratio 0.4 with a laboratory mixer at 1600 rpm for 2 minutes. The pastes were cast in cylindrical PP containers, sealed and cured at 20 C. After 1, 7, 28, 56, 90 and 365 days discs were cut from the cylinder and stored in isopropanol for 7 days to stop hydration by solvent exchange. The discs were then air-dried and stored for another 7 days under vacuum in a desiccator with silica gel to remove the isopropanol. Part of the disc was hand ground in a mortar and analyzed Table 2: Phase composition by XRD-Rietveld with rutile external standard [wt.-%].

The remainder was prepared for electron microscopy by hand polishing and em- bedded in epoxy resin. The resin mounts were gradually polished down to 14 µm. The samples were washed in isopropanol in an ultrasound bath and kept in a vacuum desiccator until microscopy measurements. Microscope setup, data collection and analysis A FEI Quanta 200 microscope with Bruker XFlash 4030 EDS detector was operated at 15 kV acceler- ating voltage and 12.5 mm working distance. At the frame size of 252 µm ⇥ 189 µm and 1024 ⇥ 768 image resolution, the pixel size was 0.246 µm ⇥ 0.246 µm. To ensure high quality of spectra in EDS mapping we chose a large spot size so the X- ray count rate would reach around 100 000 counts per second and a dwell time of 256 µs to keep the scanning speed moderate. This is a compromise between poorer statistics at high scanning speeds and larger sample damage at lower speeds. An au- tomated procedure collected BSE images and EDS maps of eight frames per sample, which was found enough for the subsequent analysis and required around 4.5 h of collection time. The amounts of Al, Si, Ca, Na, K, Mg, Fe, Ti and P in atomic-% were obtained from EDS spec- tra using profile fit with carefully collected stan- dards and PhiRhoZ matrix corrections. These calculations were carried out automatically by the Esprit software and required around 1 h per frame. The results were treated in MATLAB soft- ware. To account for the X-ray excitation vol- ume the raw data was smoothed with a Ham- ming window. The size of the window matched the size of the excitation volume modelled using Monte Carlo simulation in Casino v2.41 software (www.gel.usherbrooke.ca/casino/index.html) for a bulk composition of FA2 and the parameters the microscope was operated at. Background pixels were removed by thresholding of an associated BSE image, for which the threshold value was deter- Figure 3: An Al-Si-Ca ternary plot (A) and a ternary frequency plot (B) of the FA2 composition in atomic-%.

White contours show the arbitrary boundaries between the groups which are used in this study. 41 Durdziński et al.

The remaining data was smoothed us- ing a Hamming window and plotted in an Al-Si-Ca ternary diagram in atomic-%. A ternary plot of individual data points cannot be interpreted as it is saturated with millions of points (Figure 3A). Our solution is to re-plot the data in a ternary frequency plot (Figure 3B). For this we divide the area of the plot into 10 000 equal triangles (bins), thus corre- sponding to 1 atomic-% on each of the three axes, and we represent the number of points that fall in each bin on a linear color scale. In a frequency plot the dominant compositions appear as bright blobs while irrelevant and noise pixels are not displayed. Visual analysis of the ternary frequency plot is carried out to identify compositionally different populations and determine their ranges of chemical composition. These ranges are then used as segmen- tation criteria for image analysis. The amount of a given population is calculated as an area fraction of all pixels belonging to this population per image frame, which according to fundamental stereology equals the volume fraction of this population in the material. IV. Results and discussion Characterization of a raw fly ash BSE image of raw FA2 reveals a complex microstruc- ture and a multitude of phases distinguished by their grey levels (Figure 2). The EDS data for Al, Si and Ca is displayed with color attributed to each of these elements: red – Al, green – Si, blue – Ca (Fig- ure 2). One can observe compositionally different populations and that some particles are composed of multiple phases. The vast heterogeneity of fly ash microstructure is likely a result of different minerals contained in coal particles; as their combustion and Figure 5: Quantitative comparison of populations present in FA1 and FA2. 42 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands cooling occurs locally the melt does not undergo homogenization. Calcareous fly ashes may contain large amounts of Ca, Mg, Na and K, which can cause phase separation in glass (Pietersen, 1993; Vo- gel, 1977) and further contribute to the complexity and heterogeneity of fly ash microstructure. FA2 was composed of several populations readily distinguishable in the Al-Si-Ca ternary frequency plot (Figure 3). The predominantly silicate- and aluminosilicate- populations are represented by high and narrow peaks, which suggest well de- fined chemical composition and large abundance. The Ca-rich alumino-silicate group has a diffuse shape of nonetheless high intensity. This phase or group of phases seems to be the most abundant in the fly ash but its chemical composition spans a large section of the ternary graph. Intermediate phases such as calcium-silicates with moderate Al and alumino-silicates with moderate Ca are well defined but present in lower amounts. Phases ap- pearing at the 100 % Ca apex typically include free lime (CaO), calcium sulfates and calcium carbonate (calcite). According to XRD Rietveld analysis, FA2 contains around 4 wt.-% C3A, which appears in the plot as a blob below the calcium-rich aluminosili- cate group. The quantity of non-Ca-Al-Si phases is below 3 wt.-%, as determined by XRD-Rietveld (Ta- ble 2); they do not appear in the Ca-Al-Si diagram. To analyze the specific populations in more detail one must isolate them using selection criteria: lim- its on Al, Si and Ca were sufficient to separate the groups but in different systems any of the quanti- fied elements and more than three elements may be used. Wide limits provide the necessary margin for often broad chemical compositions and reduce the measurement error due to data scatter and poten- tially low content of the populations. We propose four main populations, roughly corresponding to (1) mainly silicate, (2) calcium-silicate with low to moderate aluminum, (3) alumino-silicate with low to moderate calcium and (4) calcium-rich alumino- silicate (Figure 4). The presented selection criteria can be used to compare different fly ashes on a quantitative basis (Figure 5). FA1 is mainly composed of aluminosil- icates with low to moderate calcium content (70 vol.-%) and calcium-silicates with low to moderate aluminum (15 vol.-%). In FA2 these two phases account together for only around 20 vol.-%. FA2 contains however a significant amount of around 55 vol.-% of potentially very reactive calcium-rich alu- minosilicate phases, which in FA1 are only present in a small quantity, below 10 vol.-%. Nevertheless, almost one fifth of FA2 volume are highly silicate phases, which are expected to not react at all. Reactivity of fly ash populations in cement paste The reaction of fly ash is a sum of reactions of dif- ferent contributing populations and it is crucial to track the reaction of each of them separately. Each fly ash population can be extracted from hydrated cement paste using a procedure extended from that for a raw fly ash. Here the difference is that one must filter out hydrate phases of compositions over- lapping with those of fly ash populations. Hydrates contain water and because neither oxygen, nor hy- drogen are quantified by EDS, the total amount of the quantified elements is lower for hydrates than for anhydrous phases. On this basis hydrates can be removed from further analysis. The previously defined criteria were used to assign pixels to fly ash populations. Volume fraction of each population was calculated from segmented images. The values at time zero were calculated from the proportions of Portland clinker, calcareous fly ash and water in the mix and their densities. Overlap of Ca-rich alumi- nosilicates with anhydrous C 3 A and C 4 AF phases from Portland clinker was taken into account. The unreacted volume fractions for each of the fly ash populations in hydrated Portland – fly ash pastes from 1 to 365 days are shown in Figure 6. The two investigated fly ashes contained significantly different proportions of the identified populations. These populations contribute differently to the re- action of fly ash. Silica-rich phases are either inert or only slightly reactive, which is an important ob- servation for FA2, containing around 20 vol.-% of these phases. In FA1 silica-rich phases were a mi- nor component. The Al-silicate and the Ca-silicate phases reacted at a moderate rate of around 50 % reacted at 90 days. These phases dominated in FA1 but accounted for only around 25 vol.-% of FA2. The calcium-rich aluminosilicates were the most reactive, exceeding 80 % degree of reaction at 28 days (FA2) and 56 days (FA1) of hydration and con- tributed the most to the reaction of FA2. Indeed, Ca-rich glasses tend to be more reactive than those with moderate and low Ca contents (Aughenbaugh et al., 2013). Large amounts of highly reactive Ca-rich alumino-silicate glass can have an important im- pact on the hydration products of PC-FA mixes, leading to formation of significant amounts of AFm and AFt phases. As these phases can interact with Cl- and SO 2 4 ions from aggressive environments they may affect the durability of the binder. Large quantities of readily available alumina from the fast reacting Ca-rich alumino-silicate glass could potentially react with carbonates from limestone (Matschei, Lothenbach, and Glasser, 2007) and im- prove its reactivity in composite cement, which may subsequently allow larger clinker replacement. 43 Durdziński et al.

Conclusions This study presents a novel technique to identify, vi- sualize and quantify populations of different chem- ical composition in a complex material, here fly ash. The technique was extended to track these popu- lations in hydrated Portland-fly ash pastes. The results confirmed that different populations con- tribute differently to the reaction of fly ash, which strengthens the view that fly ashes should not be judged by their bulk chemical composition only. Understanding of fly ash composition, reactivity and effect on concrete properties is a challenge for cement research. The method presented here pro- vides a tool that could facilitate investigations and may lead to an improved classification and use of calcareous fly ashes in concrete.

It deals with historical importance and with advantages and disadvantages of actual possibilities. Methods that utilize transmitted or reflected light are described in this paper as well as the method of high temperature microphotometry and possibilities of utilization of optical microscopy in a cement factory. Keywords: Portland clinker, optical microscopy, microstructure I. Introduction Optical microscopy played a significant role in the development of mineralogy of cement clinker al- ready in the pioneer research of LeChatelier and Törnebohm at the end of 19 th century. However, the importance of optical microscopy currently de- creases due to a great development of measuring and analytical techniques. Compared to other meth- ods, the uniqueness of this method lies firstly in the possibility of qualitative and quantitative anal- ysis of clinker phases and secondly in the ability to study the structure of clinker, which reflects the processes of the clinker formation (Maki, 2004). The optical microscope enables direct observa- tion of structure and phase composition of Port- land clinker. The phase composition of clinker is the result of two main production operations – the preparation of raw meal and burning – and clinker microstructure is a result of these operations. It often shows also the properties of the source of raw meal at the locality. The composition and the structure of clinker also significantly influences the properties of cement; therefore clinker is an inter- mediate product with crucial importance in both determination of these properties and analysis of preceding processes. Microscopy is irreplaceable during laboratory re- search on clinker. In the production process, micro- scopic analysis is not necessary, but provides useful information besides common chemical and XRD methods. If the situation requires, other methods with higher resolution should be used additionally, such as electron microscopy. However, a problem with representativeness of observed objects occurs due to the scale used. During microscopic evaluation, human factor as well as image definition has to be taken into account. Overcoming of weaknesses of optical microscopy lies in development of methods for better image processing and particularly in exact recognition of morphology of every clinker mineral. II. The process of Portland cement clinker formation Optical microscopy played and still plays a signifi- cant role in the research on mechanism and kinetics of the formation of Portland clinker and in the re- search on the influence of different factors on the formation and properties of Portland clinker, e.g. the temperature programming, i.e. the temperature of preheating, the temperature of firing and also the chemical and mineralogical composition of the raw meal. A significant step in the process of clinker forma- tion is the liquid phase creation. In the beginning of the sintering process, before the creation of liquid begins, decomposition processes of the raw meal oc- cur (such as dehydratation and dehydroxylation of clay minerals and micas, dissociation of carbonates) and also reactions in solid phase develop, which can be monitored by DTA. In current production systems, these processes run firstly in dispersed state in the heat exchanger (or in calciner), then in loose state in rotary kilns; these processes are over- all highly endothermic. Belite is created already 45 Staněk & Sulovský during the dissociation of calcite via reactions in solid phase (Chromý, 1976). The clinker liquid is created in the beginning of the sintering process. Before this happens, local eu- tectics are created in areas with higher Fe content, which is the beginning of aggregation of loose ma- terial. Gradual creation of continuous clinker liquid is at the beginning accompanied by quick exother- mal generation of belite (Chromý, 1982; Kondo and Choi, 1968; Christensen et al., 1978; Staněk et al., 2004), which is soon finished, and the end of liquid creation is strongly endothermic. Before the end of belite formation according to equation 2C + S = C 2 S, a thin layer of alite is cre- ated around aggregates of free lime, the layer being called “the limiting layer”. The last, slowest and therefore critical reaction of alite formation runs according to equation C + C 2 S = C 3 S. Free lime dissolves in the liquid on the surface of the aggre- gate, then it is transported by diffusion through the liquid phase of alite layer; alite crystallizes on the outer surface of this layer immediately after the dis- solving belite. The concentration difference of CaO in liquid between the surface of free lime aggregate and the C 3 S – C 2 S border is stable and very small (Johansen, 1979). That is why the speed of this reaction is very low and progressively decreases with the degree of conversion (Christensen et al., 1978; Chromý and Hrabě, 1982). Removing of the last percent of free lime requires almost doubling of isothermal burning time, which is an important finding for the energetic economy of production. Along with the creation of liquid at the begin- ning of the sintering zone aggregation of originally loose material occurs. The intensity of granulation decreases with the increasing conversion by the reaction C + C 2 S = C 3 S, i.e. with increasing alite content in clinker. Granules with excess of belite are plastic with higher coverage of their surface by liquid (due to closer packing of spherical belite grains, which do not intergrow), whereas the later intergrowing angular alite crystals build a solid structure of grains with lower coverage of the sur- face by liquid. Further aggregation of particles runs particularly by sticking of the clinker powder on the surface of granules or by aggregation of smaller particles (Weber, 1989). III. Relationship between mineralogical and chemical composition of clinker The mineralogical composition of clinker deter- mines the properties of cement. There were two basic methods to evaluate phase composition of clinker in the not far-off history (Aldrige, 1975). The methods have nearly the same precision but 46 the results significantly differ in accuracy. The meth- ods are microscopic point counting method and a method of calculation of composition from chemi- cal analysis. The main equation for the calculation of the so- called potential phase composition of clinker was derived by Bogue. The calculated phase composi- tion of clinker considerably differs from the real one, sometimes by 10% or more. The reason for the difference between the calculated and the real phase composition of fabricated clinker are devia- tions from the assumed chemical composition of clinker phases, which depend on the content of minor oxides in the raw meal, on kinetics of re- actions and the cooling rate, i.e. above all on the source of the raw materials and the production fa- cilities. The possibility of finding a universal valid method for calculation of phase composition of in- dustrial clinker from chemical analysis is highly improbable. Such method would have to take into account the interrelationships in the creation of solid solutions of clinker phases in conditions of non-equilibrium crystallization, the differences in the raw meal source localization and in production facilities. At present, phase composition can be assessed by another method: X-ray diffraction analysis. X- ray diffractometers with quick detectors (PSD) and Rietveld optimalisation (Schmidt and Kern, 2001) may provide relatively precise information about the phase composition of the clinker, but cannot give information about the structure of the clinker. However, another source (Pritula et al., 2003) men- tions, that Rietveld analysis for Portland clinker does not give sufficiently precise and accurate re- sults yet. IV. Optical microscopy methods The polarization microscope is optimal for the re- search on cement raw materials and cement prod- ucts because of its universality. With the micro- scope, powder samples and thin sections can be observed in transmitted light, or polished-sections in reflected light. Transmitted light Mineralogical composition of powder samples of raw meal, kiln dusts, cements, slags, ashes, gypsum etc. can be observed in transmitted light in petro- logical microscope. The microscopic specimen is prepared by mounting the sample on microscope slide, then a drop of suitable immersion liquid is added and the sample is covered by a cover slip. The phase composition is identifiable by character- istic optical properties of minerals such as color, cleavage, shape, index of refraction, birefringence, 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands pleochroism, isotropy and anisotropy, extinction angle and other special properties. Furthermore, it is possible to prepare thin sec- tions, when the observed sample is cut by a dia- mond blade saw, than it is ground and glued to a microscope slide with appropriate suitable liquid. After glueing it is cut again by the diamond saw to get only a few tenths of millimeter in thin wafer, which is subsequently ground to thickness of about 0.03 mm. After that a cover slip is stuck on the surface with the same medium. This preparation is appropriate to determine the mineralogical compo- sition and structure of clinker and rocks destined for preparation of raw meals. The preparation may be used also for powder samples, but it has to begin with preparation of casts from the powder mixed with appropriate mounting material, which can be cut and ground. Reflected light In the cement industry, observation in reflected light is used more often, because the preparation of the specimen is simpler and the main interme- diate product – Portland clinker – and possibly also cement can be observed. It is not necessary for the observer to have a special mineralogical- petrographic knowledge, a training by an expert is sufficient. The polished section is prepared as a cast from representative clinker chippings (or cement) in an appropriate matrix. The surface is ground and at the end polished with diamond paste. During the reaction of clinker silicates and free lime with fumes of acetic acid, a layer of reaction product is formed on the surface of the polished sec- tion. The thickness of the layer is a function of the CaO : SiO 2 ratio. Due to the interference of reflected light these minerals get distinctly different colours (Chromý, 1974a). Practical realization consist of a short exposition (around 1 s) of the polished section placed on piece of textile tissue, which is tightened over the neck of a bottle with acetic acid. Beyond this time the bottle has to be covered by a glass plate. Alite crystals are pale blue to blue-green, belite grains are brown and free lime is bright yel- low, orange or red (see Figure 1). Interstitial mass cannot be colored but if it is well crystalized, its components can be distinguished, C 3 A creates gray and C 4 AF white areas in the interstitial mass (see Figure 2). Compared to other methods, the advantage of optical microscopy is the possibility to observe also the structure of clinker, which tells us more about processes during its formation. The size of alite and belite crystals can be measured, their shape and the inclusions in alite crystals can be observed, their zonation, the creation of lamellas in belite, which indicates polymorphous composition. Due to this method, the degree of burning and therefore the de- gree of crystallization of silicates can be evaluated, which can influence the initial strength of cement. From the observed structure, the properties of raw meal can be estimated, particularly its reactivity. It is also possible to identify aggregates of belite, formed as residues after big grains of SiO 2 , or to reveal excessive amounts of SO 3 or MgO in the clinker. High temperature microphotometry High temperature microphotometry is a special op- tical method, which among other things allows to identify polymorphous composition of clinker min- erals alite and belite. In common industrial clinkers, alite is present mainly in two monoclinic modifica- tions M1 a M3 or in their mixtures. This informa- tion is important because clinker with alite modi- fication M1 can have higher compressive strength (up to by 10%) than the clinker with M3 modifica- tion (Staněk and Sulovský, 2002). In belite, high- temperature modifications (a, a’) can be identified that have higher hydraulic activity compared to b modification. This method combines optical microscope, mi- crophotometer and a heating stage for automatic registration of the course of thermal changes in minerals as well as in inhomogenous materials up to 1430 C (Chromý, 1974b, Staněk and Mátl, 2003). The starting modification of clinker minerals alite and belite can be detected from the mineral bire- fringence changes with temperature. This requires quality double-sided polished section of the mea- sured sample. A slice of material is cut from sam- ple, mounted on a slide, polished, than the slice is flipped and re-mounted on a new slide, and polished on the exposed surface. Polished section is unstuck by evaporating the resin at high tem- perature in a fume hood. The polished section is then placed on a platinum support plate with a hole that enables the light passage into the heat- ing stage of the microscope. The intensity of light (transmitted through optically anisotropic crystal between crossed nicols) and a relative retardation of the beam can be utilized for determination of birefringence using a microphoyometer. However, the method is sufficiently precise only when small beam delays are measured and it is comparable with other methods only if the interference colours are of the first order. Therefore, the polished section needs to be as thin as possible. For the determination of the modification of alite, which exhibits low birefringence, the suffi- cient thickness of the thin section is 10 – 15 µm and the maximum heating temperature 1100 C. Belite has higher value of birefringence so the thickness 47 cement. From the observed structure, the properties of raw meal can be estimated, particularly its reactivity. It is also possible to identify aggregates of belite, formed as residues after big grains of SiO 2 , or to reveal excessive Staněk & Sulovský amounts of SO 3 or MgO in the clinker.

V. Quantitative phase analysis of clinker Clinker granules usually differ in the degree of burning, therefore, polished sections representing average phase composition of the clinker must be used. The whole volume of the clinker sample is crushed to pass through a 1 mm sieve. The crushing process has to be repeated and be as mild as possible not to influence the results by different grindability of alite and belite (Chromý, 1978). The 0.045 – 1 mm fraction of the crushed clinker sample is quartered to get the volume that is necessary to prepare polished section. Crushed clinker is mixed with mounting liquid (e.g. epoxy resin) in cylindrical mold made of aluminium film. The hardened pellet is cut along the cylinder axis to get a rectangular area of the polished section. The cut area is firstly ground with SiC papers of different roughnesses, then polished with diamond paste on a textile cloth. Quantitative phase composition in vol. % is de- termined by a microscopic point counting method in polished section dyed by fumes of acetic acid. Volume percentages of clinker phases are propor- tional to the number of points, which are evenly distributed. The task is to identify the phase un- der the crosshair of ocular and presses appropriate 48 button on the semiautomatic device which registers the phase and moves the preparation to a position at given distance. Precision of the determination depends on the number of registered points and on the content of the phase. Presumed deviation of determination 3 can be calculated as standard deviation Sc from binominal distribution: S c = r p · ( 100 n p ) (1) where p is content of determined phase and n is total number of registered points in the area. The influence of human factor has to be taken into account, i.e. errors in identification of the phase and errors in registration of points may occur. The result can be also influenced by the choice of the material the microscopic specimen consists of. The main error originates in sampling and the error of polished section analysis is reflected in the Sc value. If 2000 points are registered, then the resulting stan- dard deviation for alite (in 60 – 80 vol. %) is Sc = 1.5 – 1.8 %, for belite and the interstitial mass (in 5 – 20 vol. %) Sc = 0.6 – 1.0 % and for free lime (around 1 vol. %) Sc = 0.2 %. Specific weights of clinker minerals (in g · cm 3 ) can be used to recalculate the results from volume percentage to weight percentage: C 3 S – 3.15; C 2 S – 3.28; C 3 A – 3.03; C 4 AF – 3.77; free lime – 3.35; periclase – 3.65 (g · cm 3 ).

Introduction Although the southern part of Belgium has several good quality limestones and sandstones, the market is flooded with imported exotic natural stones. In contrast to our large experience with the native stones, the characteristics of the imported natural stone are only known by the laboratory assessments. We lack the knowledge of their behavior in our climate and our building applications within one or several decades. Over the last years we have been receiving a significant number of complaints concerning cracking of bluish gray colored compact limestones. Microscopic analyses show that these compact limestones, in most cases, resemble in fact more a marble than a limestone. Signs of recrystallization and secondary dolomitization of the calcareous ma- trix are pointed out by petrographic analysis. Even though the matrix is that of a marble, the fossils of the original limestone are still recognizable. The ob- served recrystallization due to metamorphosis cre- ates less adhesion between the calcite and dolomite crystals. Other observed features such as pyrite and stylolithes can also be linked to cracking or flaking of the stone tile. These microscopic observations proof a weakening of the material which makes it more susceptible to frost action, thermal expansion or mechanical shock. Figure 1: Crack in a Vietnamese limestone pavement. Belgian and Asian limestones: a general compar- ison The Belgian Bluestone is a special facies belonging to the Carboniferous, Dinatian (Tournaisian- about 355 million years) and mined in four regions in the southern part of Belgium. The bluestone originates always from the same geological layers. The petrog- raphy defines the Belgian Bluestone as a compact limestone of sedimentary origin and is the result of the clustering of innumerable crinoïde- or sea lily residues that are held together with varying 55 Bams & Nicaise Figure 2: Crack in a Chinese limestone pavement. amounts micrite and sparite. The blue color of the stone can be attributed to the presence of very finely dispersed carbon. (de Barquin, F., 2001) The appearance of the Vietnamese limestone is similar to the Belgian one as the constituent com- ponents are largely identical. Also in terms of age, there is a similarity. They are also of Carboniferous age (Perm - 350-270 million years). The limestone is mined in the area of Than Hoa (de Barquin, F. 2006) and comes from dozens of different quarries where it is exploited from many geological layers. This result in the existence of a large diversity in the nature of the limestone which can be a biomicrite (bioclastic packstone) and can vary up to almost a marble, called a metalimestone. The limestones which are supplied to Europe tend to be a mixture of stones from different quarries which can lead to a large difference in color between the delivered stone elements, ranging from dark blue to light gray. Chinese blue coloured limestone differs from the two other natural stones, as well in composition as in age. It concerns a oolitic grainstone (oosparite) of the Middle Cambrian (500 million years). Besides (partly) sparitised oolites, the limestone contains a certain amount of dolomite and ferriferous miner- als, which give this blue coloured limestone a far different aspect as the stones mentioned above. The oolitic limestone is won in the hills of the Shang- dong province, in the Northeast of China. The extraction is done by dozens of small family en- treprises who excavate, horizontally and vertically, those hills in small quarries. Various geological lay- ers are exploited and collected in a small number of processing entreprises. The geological nature of the supplied and fixed Asiatic limestones is rather variable due to way of mining by uncoordinated small family businesses. The last years an increase of plaints concerning breaking and fissuring of these limestones is noted. Microscopic examination was conducted in order 56 Figure 3: Different geological type of Vietnamese lime- stone Figure 4: Discolouration of Chinese limestone to explain the pathology of cracking. II. Methodology For optical investigation of the limestones, thin sec- tions were made. The preparation and finishing of the thin sections and polished sections was per- formed according to NBN EN 12407. The thin sec- tions have a thickness of 25 to 30 µm and a surface of 3 ⇥ 5 cm. The samples were impregnated under vacuum with a fluorescent epoxy resin allowing studying the porosity and cracks under reflected fluorescent light. The mineralogy of the stone sam- ples was examined under transmitted light (for the non-opaque minerals). Additional characterization of the mineralogy was carried out with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker AXS D8-advance diffractometer). The samples were crushed and pulverized. The obtained powder was pressed into a special holder and placed in the diffractometer. The rotating (speed of 30.000 rpm) sample is irradiated with CuKa-radiation (40 kV and 40 mA). The analysis was executed with a divergence slit of 1 and covers 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands an 2q-area of 10 to 75 with a step size of 0,02 (1s per step). To investigate the composition and form of the opaque minerals an Environmental Scanning Elec- tron Microscope (SEM) (Quanta 200 FEG) fitted with an EDS-system (EDAX - Apollo 40 Silicon drift detector and Genesis XM-4i system) was used. The ESEM analysis is carried out with a BSE detec- tor. The specific used conditions are mentioned on each individual picture. III. Petrographic analysis For the uncovering of a possible cause of the crack formation in the Asian compact limestones, only the petrographic analysis of these two stones will be discussed. Figure 5: Petrographic analysis by transmitted light and plane polars - overview of the composition and mi- crostructure of a metalimestone (Vietnamese). Vietnamese limestone: composition Generally, this limestone consists mainly of fossils and allochems in a micritic to sparitic matrix. De- pending on the degree of metamorphism the con- stituent parts can whether or not be identified and is the calcitic sediment converted to microsparite or sparite. The allochems that can be recognized, as it is not a metalimestone, are crinoidic residues, shell fragments, pellets and sporadic coral fragments and foraminifera. Dispersed in the matrix, dolomite and opaque minerals can be found. These minerals can also be observed in the stylolites or in the vicinity of these features. In thin section, the dolomite crystals can be identified based on their typical diamond shape. A XRD-analyse (and Rietveld evaluation method) showed that about 30% of the limestone consists of dolomite and the remaining 70% is calcite. It can be assumed that there is a certain amount of anhedral dolomite crystals present in the matrix that can not be recognized in a thin section. This analyis was performed on one of the test samples (not representative amount for the rock formation). On basis of an ESEM analysis, it was found that the opaque minerals present in the matrix (less than 1%) are pyrite crystals. Individual crystals show a cubic shape, but they are often present as spheric microcrystals that not exceed 1 micrometer in size. Several of these microcrystals form small agglomerates, in this case it is called framboidal pyrite. Figure 6: Petrographic analysis by transmitted light and plane polars - overview of the composition and mi- crostructure of a biomicrite (Vietnamese) with mortar beneath. Vietnamese limestone: microstructure In some Vietnamese limestones, the original micritic allochems are converted to (micro)sparite. This eliminates the distinct delineation of the particles and they become unrecognizable in a thin section. Furthermore in the matrix, calcite crystals with a Figure 7: ESEM image of framboidal pyrite. 57 Bams & Nicaise Figure 8: EDS analysis of the framboidal pyrite in Figure 7. Figure 9: Petrographic analysis by transmitted light and plane polars – residues of pellets and foraminifera within a sparitic and dolomitic matrix. size up to 50 micrometer can be observed. The presence of the (micro)sparitization and the relative large size of the crystals show that a recrystalliza- tion has occurred and that the calcitic matrix is not the sparite as in a sedimentary rock. The limestone generally has a low porosity, and two types can be defined. Firstly, there exists an intragranular porosity which is formed by the cleav- age planes in the calcite crystals, and secondly there is an intergranular porosity present, which is repre- sented by space around the calcite crystals. In addition, the rock exhibit the presence of fine calcitic veins and continuous stylolites that may or may not be open. Chinese limestone: composition This natural stone consists mainly of circular or elliptical oolites with a diameter ranging from 50 micrometers to 2.5 milimeters. They occur with a cylindrical layer build-up or without this layer build-up as a result of recrystallization. In the cen- ter of the oolites often rhombic dolomite crystals are present. Correspondingly opaque minerals can 58 Figure 10: Petrographic analysis by transmitted light and plane polars – shell fragment in a recrystallized and dolomitized matrix. Figure 11: Petrographic analysis by transmitted light and plane polars – overview of the composition and mi- crostructure of a Chinese limestone. be noted in the middle but these crystals can also be present according to the micritic layers of the oolites. Sometimes the nucleus is a shell fragment around which a (elliptical) oolite has formed. The oolites are held together by a sparite cement and microsparite. In some specimens the sparite crys- tals can be up to 250 micrometers and show cal- citic cleavage planes. Dispersed throughout the matrix opaque minerals can be found but they are also observed in areas with a high concentration of dolomite crystals. An XRD analysis was performed on a powdered stone sample (not representative amount for the rock formation) in order to be able to estimate the dolomite content. The analysis indicates that there is about 71% calcite and 29% dolomite present. An ESEM analysis identified the in the thin sec- tion observered opaque mineral as both cubic and framboïdal pyrite crystals. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 12: Petrographic analysis by transmitted light and plane polars – dolomite concentration in a sparitic matrix with large crystals.

Chinese limestone: microstructure Figure 13: ESEM image of framboidal and cubic pyrite Figure 14: EDS analysis of the pyrite in Figure 13. Throughout the natural stone fine calcitic veins are observed. These veins contain more different crys- tal sizes than the matrix. The present stylolites are rather short stylolites which are oriented in the same direction than the continuous styloliets ob- served in the Vietnamese limestone. Within these solution surfaces, accumulations of opaque miner- als are present. Both veins and stylolites can occur as closed and as open features. The porosity of the limestone is low and mainly intergranular. The open veins and stylolites disre- garded, the porosity can consist of small voids in the cement and open spaces along the sparite crys- tals. Furthermore, the oolitic nuclei are relatively porous by their dolomitisation. From the analysis of the composition and the mi- crostructure can be concluded that the geological nature of the Asian stones can vary from a sedi- mentary limestone in which still micrite is present up to a metalimestone which almost can be con- 59 Bams & Nicaise sidered as a marble. The Vietnamese limestone is situated between a dolomite bearing biopelsparite and a dolomite bearing metalimestone. The Chi- nese limestone on the other hand, departs from a dolomite bearing oösparite. IV. Fissuring pathology As with all the limestones, the veins and stylolites are the weak zones of a stone element along which cracking may occur. The petrographic analysis of the Asian limestones have revealed a complemen- tary weakening of the rock. The observed rela- tively large calcite crystals in the matrix and the conversion of the micritic allochems to microsparite, indicate recrystallization of the rock through meta- morphosis. As a result, there is a certain porosity present along the sparite crystals. In addition, a sec- ondary dolomitisation slightly increased the level of intergranular porosity near the concentrations of dolomite. 60 The created porousness can be seen as a network of micro-cracks that makes the rock more brittle. When these stone elements are applicated as pave- ment, they will be susceptible to frost action, ther- mal expansion or mechanical shock. This will lead to cracking, breaking or flaking. (Nicaise, D., 2010) V. Conclusion Not only physical and mechanical testing is im- portant to gain knowledge of the behavior of a for- eign natural stone, but microscopic analysis pointed out that cracking of compact limestones is mostly caused by a combination of its mineralogical nature and the unfavorable choice of the stone application.

This group comprises stones such as slate s.s., shale, phyllite, and carbonate slate, but even schist, cinerite, sandstone, meta-arkose, schistose quartzite, quartzitic flagstone, gneiss and mica schist. However, the main lithologies used for roofing are the first four. All these rocks have a well-developed and layered structure in common, allowing them to be split into large, thin and regular tiles. There are several places in the world where roofing stone could be quarried, but nowadays the main exploitations are located in Spain, China and Brazil. The difference in nature (petrology and characteristics) of the roofing stones from different parts of the world plays a major role in the final use, although builders often think that all stones are equally suited for the same purpose. Generally speaking, almost all of the World’s roofing slates are mainly composed of quartz, mica and chlorite, together with some accessory minerals such as iron sulfides, iron oxides and carbonates. The weathering of these two minerals creates characteristic pathologies, oxidation and gypsification, respectively. Some iron sulfides alteration causes oxidation, which can be seen as brown to red stain marks over the surface of the tile. Oxidation is far the main cause of complaints and rejections, even when is just a aesthetical issue. On the other hand, gypsification can lead to the tile destruction, but it has less impact on the complaints. Since weathering is related to the mineralogical composition and so indirectly to the origin of the roofing slate, identifying and quantifying that mineralogy becomes critical to secure a proper use of the slate. In this sense, optical examination with Polarized Optical Light (POL) using both transmitted and reflected light and X-ray Diffraction are powerful methods, especially when combined with other techniques, such as Micro Computed X-ray Tomography (MCT). POL and XRD give information about the type of the rock, its internal structure and mineral components, while MCT gives information about the occurrence, size and distribution of the metallic minerals, specially the iron sulfides. This works revises the main types of roofing slates found nowadays in the market, together with their main characteristics found by POL, XRD and MCT. Keywords: Roofing slate, petrography, MCT, weathering, quality I. Introduction The term roofing slate comprises the natural rocks used in construction which have in common the capacity to be split into plane, thin and regular tiles that are used for roofing. Then, these rocks must have a very defined cleavage (Walsh, 2003), that can be of sedimentary or metamorphic origin. There are many rocks with these characteristics (Cárdenes et al., 2014), but only a few can be mined as roof- ing slates. The main exploitations of roofing slates are found in Spain, China and Brazil. In terms of world’s production of natural stone, roofing slate is the third stone in volume (Figure 1). Roofing slate industry is then the economical engine for several regions in the world, with a volume of exporta- tions for the year 2013 of 1,128.1 million tons for a value of 690.8 million $ (UNSTATS, 2014). The average price of the slate is currently around 612 $/ton. However, the price for each country depends greatly on factors like the quality and availability of the slate. For Spain, the main producer, the average price is 710 $/ton. Spanish slate is well consolidated in the market, being sold mainly in Europe. New producing countries, like China (394 $/ton) and Brazil (472 $/ton) have lower prices, since their product is not completely accepted by the market, maybe due to its heterogeneity (Cár- denes et al. 2014). This fact is sometimes due to a higher hardness combined with a difficult for- matting with supplementary breakings and losses during roof coverings. Also the poor quality of the first imported Chinese slates, with some very high carbonate content or sometimes with a high poros- ity combined with their rapid weathering made that their products are technically less competitive. On the other hand, countries with a long tradition of slate mining, like the United Kingdom (745 $/ton) 61 prices, since their product is not completely accepted by the market, maybe due to its heterogeneity (Cárdenes et al. 2014). This fact is sometimes due to a higher hardness combined with a difficult formatting with supplementary breakings and losses during roof coverings. Also the poor quality of the first imported Chinese slates, with some very high carbonate content or sometimes with a high porosity combined with their rapid Cardenes et al. weathering made that their products are technically less competitive. On the other hand, countries with a long tradition of slate mining, like the United Kingdom (745 $/ton) and Germany (1.551 $/ton), still maintain some remaining quarries that provide slate for restorations of architectural heritage and special buildings.

In terms of chemical composition, SiO 2 always comprises more than 50% of the total weight of the sample, followed by Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 (Cárdenes et al., 2014). Color of roofing slates greatly vary depending on the type of stone. For most of them, the color ranges between light and dark grey with a slight blue hue, but it is possible to find green, red and purple slates. Green color is mainly due to the existence of clinochlore, while red and purple colors are due to the presence of Fe 3+ . Color essentially reflects both mineral content and chemistry. The darkness of the slate is mainly conditioned by the amount of organic matter that can be found. This organic matter is present under the form of graphite and can range up to 2% in some slates (Cárdenes et al., 2012a). and Germany (1.551 $/ton), still maintain some re- maining quarries that provide slate for restorations of architectural heritage and special buildings. conditioned by the amount of organic matter that can be found.

It can be measured directly by using laboratory weathering tests, or indirectly through the petrographic characterization of the slate itself. According to the slate norm EN 12326 (AEN/CTN_22, 2011), the oxidation potential is estimated by accelerated weathering with the thermal cycling (TC) test, while content in carbonates is determined by chemical analysis and can be estimated with the sulfur dioxide exposure test. TC test is based on hydration and de-hydration of the iron sulfides. For the oxidation potential, the accelerated 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Rutile has an AC close to pyrite, but its proportion in the bulk mineralogy of the sample is insignificant (belo 0.01%), so the error induced in the total quantification of iron sulfides can be assumed.

Then, it is always very important to have good petrographic description of the sample before undertaking the MCT analysis. third choice. Gypsification may cause also change in color. The occurrence of carbonates in roofing slates usually lead to gypsification, a process by which the carbonate content reacts with the atmo- spheric sulfates, forming gypsum. Since gypsum has a higher volume than carbonate, its growth in the slate matrix causes swellings that can lead to tile disintegration. However, economic losses due to gypsification are much lower than those due to oxidation. From an economical point of view, the impact of oxidation is more important than gypsifi- cation (Figure 2). Oxidation potential has become then the problem for slate quality, and is probably the main concern for slate customers. It can be measured directly Figure 3.

SEM+EDX is a good com- plement of these two techniques, but it should not be the main technique (Gómez-Fernández et al., 2009). The information given by these techniques can be improved by MCT, that incorporates the 3D analysis, taking into account its limitations in res- olution. Generally speaking, MCT discriminates the elements of a sample by their difference in den- sity and atomic number. These two characteristics are described by the Attenuation Coefficient (AC) (Cnudde et al., 2013). In roofing slates, the main minerals (quartz, mica and chlorites) have different AC values than the iron sulfides (mainly pyrite), so it is possible to clearly distinguish them from the rock matrix (Figure 3). However, for some types of roofing slates, like phyllites, mica is composed mainly by biotite, which have an AC close to the one for iron sulfides. Also, common detrital min- erals like monazite and rutile, have AC that may lead to confusion. Rutile has an AC close to pyrite, but its proportion in the bulk mineralogy of the sample is insignificant (below 0.01%), so the error induced in the total quantification of iron sulfides can be assumed. On the other hand, monazite has a higher AC than pyrite. In roofing slates, this min- eral is usually regular in size (around 200 µm) with a characteristic rounded shape, so it can be easily identified during the POL analysis, and thus its oc- currence can be taken into account when doing the 64 Up to 5% mineral abundance <1 µm Up to 1-5 µm of voxel size MCT analysis. Then, it is always very important to have a good petrographic description of the sample before undertaking the MCT analysis. Iron sulfides can clearly be determined in the slate matrix by means of MCT (Vavro et al., 2014), with the additional advantage that this method is not completely destructive, as the others. MCT it- self does not modify any property of the slate, but the sample preparation destroys a certain amount of the original slate by drilling the cylinders that will be used for the scans. MCT analysis of the iron sulfides of the slates can accurately show the size, shape and distribution of them of the slates’ matrix. However, MCT uses small cylindrical sam- ples of several millimeters of diameter. Also, the information about chemical composition of the ob- jects analyzed can only be deduced by comparing among them. For a cylindrical sample of 10 mm di- ameter and 10 mm length, the expected resolution is close to 6 µm voxel. For smaller sample sizes, resolution increases. Size, shape and mineralogy are closely linked. According to the Aggregational Model of framboid formation (Wilkin et al., 1997), pyrite is formed by aggregation and pyritization of FeS compounds. Then, pyrrhotite constitutes a pre- cursor of pyrite. The framboids have sizes between 5 and 150 µm. Processes described in the Aggre- gational Model are held during the sin- and post- depositional stages of the sediment. Later processes, like hydrothermalism, can alter and even add new iron sulfides to the slate, but then the morphologies 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Table 2: Macroscopic description of the slates studied in this work.

Regarding to XRD, the composition is rather similar for all the rocks but for ITL, the car- bonate slate. In this sample, carbonate is the main component (Table 3). This type of slate is com- piled in EN 12326 under the definition "carbonate slate", for slates with more than 20% volume of carbonate. Mineral determination was then calcu- lated by POL and XRD. The main minerals and the structure were clearly defined with these two VDR techniques, but the determination of minor min- erals was not possible. Iron sulfides content was only able to be determined by naked-eye estimation on POL (Figure 5), together with an estimation of the mineralogical species (pyrite and pyrrhotite). The XRD (Figure 6) gave no information about the iron sulfides, even when their presence may cause weathering problems. Petrographic description ITL BRA: Lepidoblastic texture, with grain sizes be- tween 10 and 50 µm. There is a clear alignment following sedimentary planes (S o ). These planes are noticed due to iron oxides accumulations par- allel to them (Figure 5). Main minerals: Quartz, chlorite, mica and opaque minerals (iron sulfides and organic matter, sizes 5 – 50 µm) homogeneously distributed all over the slate. VXE ITL: Lepidoblastic texture, grain sizes between 10 and 50 µm, with an evident slaty cleavage (S 1 ) deformation.

Both chlorite and quartz present elongation according to S 1 (Figure 5). Mica are distributed in dense and continuous levels. Main minerals: quartz, chlorite and mica, accessory min- erals: iron sulfides and chloritoid. The iron sulfides are forming large cubes (up to 5 mm length) that in some parts are being transform into goethite. VXE: Porfiro-lepidoblastic texture, composed by alternating levels of quartz and green chlorite (clinochlore) of homogeneous sizes (5-50 µm) Some grains of chlorite have a bigger size that the rest (Figure 5), up to 100 µm. Main minerals: quartz, chlorite, mica and opaque minerals. These opaque minerals are mainly iron sulfides, homogeneously distributed all over the slate, with sizes between 10-40 µm. The MCT analysis (Figure 7) shows the abun- dance and size distribution of the iron sulfides (Fig- ure 8) with a voxel size higher than 6 µm. The sample that presents the highest content in iron sulfides is VDR. This slate is known to have a high oxidation potential, produced by large cubes of pyrite. It has the largest size distribution of pyrite, with sizes ranging up to 1.8 mm. The average vol- ume for the pyrite inclusions is 1340 µm 3 , and the total content is 0.71%. The second slate in iron sul- fides content is BRA, with an average volume of 400 µm 3 and a total content of 0.05%. For this Brazilian slate, oxidation does not represent a real problem,. Nevertheless, in some buildings it has developed a color change, or tanning, like in the new stadium of Léon, Spain. Finally, ITL and VXE have little and scarce iron sulfides (240 µm 3 , 0.01% and 160 µm 3 , 0.04% average volumes and total content of iron 68 sulfides, respectively). These slates have never pre- sented documented oxidation troubles at all, even when ITL has suffered some complaints regarding troubles caused by their carbonate content. V. Conclusions One of the main factors for quality on roofing slates is the content of iron sulfides. Techniques to deter- mine the oxidation potential of iron sulfides can be distinguished in weathering performance tests and detailed petrographic characterization. Weathering tests are standardized, but they generally apply accelerated conditions to reduce experiment time, but which not necessarily reflect realistic use condi- tions. MCT analysis of four different roofing slate varieties were able to characterize two different pop- ulations of iron sulfides, micro (between 5 and 210 µm size) and macro (generally visible with naked eye). The micro iron sulfides can be associated with slight and homogeneous color changes in the en- tire slate tile surface, while the macro iron sulfides constitutes potential oxidation spots. From a com- mercial quality point of view, macro iron sulfides are a potential source of oxidation, while micro iron sulfides do not represent a risk. Then, the size and distribution of the iron sulfides present in a roofing slate is closely related with the oxidation potential. Petrological characterization techniques gathered in the roofing slate norm EN 12326, XRD and POL, are very limited in terms of deep characterizing the iron sulfides features. Besides, the measured iron sulfides contents in the samples ranges from 0.71% till 0.01%, far away from the minimum mineral con- tent needed for the XRD determination. Only with 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands MCT the real distribution of the iron sulfides can be accurately described, so it is suggested to perform at least a MCT scan in the initial characterization of a rock as roofing slate. On the other hand, MCT uses small cylindrical samples of several millime- ters of diameter, so it is necessary to determine first if the results are representative. Also, no direct chemical information is provided. The use of dif- ferent techniques combined (POL, SEM and MCT, together with weathering tests from EN 12326) can accurately determine the distribution, size and oxi- dation potential of iron sulfides on roofing slates.

Génie Civil et Environnemental, École des Mines de Douai, Douai, France. b SPIN/Géosciences, École des Mines de Saint-Étienne, Saint-Étienne, France. ⇤ vincent.thiery@mines-douai.fr Abstract Burnt colliery spoil is a typical waste material from former coal mining regions (e.g. North of France, Tchelyabinsk coal basin in Russia, Silesia in Poland. . . ) where mining residues are stored in heaps. When such coal tips are caught on fire, the materials undergo burning of organic residues, baking and sometimes melting and recrystallization. The resulting product, which is generally red but also yellowish, orange or violet, finds various uses as a building material: roadmaking, backfill, decorative aggregate for private domestic roads, sand for tennis court; it has also been used in the past to design synthetic aggregates (Gutt and Nixon, 1979). Based on a set of samples from various localities in France (Guy et al., 2001; Masalehdani et al., 2009; Masalehdani and Paquette, 2013), we discuss the petrography and mineralogy of burnt colliery spoil. The highly heterogeneous initial leftover material from the coal mining (sandstones, coal dust, pelites, limestone. . . ) as well as the occasional use of tips as garbage repositories is at the origin of a high diversity of textures within the materials. The high temperatures (800-1000 C, sometimes more) reached during the burning of the heaps leaves no remains of organic matter and are associated with a mineralogical evolution (clay dehydration, oxidation of sulfides. . . ) and most often with the preservation of the initial rock texture. The local melting of those rocks lead to the formation of glassy products characterized by a high amount of amorphous content. All those mineralogical evolutions, presenting some similarities with the manufacture of bricks, contribute to the hardness of the material and to its characteristics because of its sintering. Finally, secondary minerals (gypsum, zeolites) fill fractures (Masalehdani et al., 2009). Keywords: coal mining waste, petrography, annealing, baking, aggregate I. Introduction Coal mining is probably the best known type of mining within the general knowledge, associating the black of coal with the dirtiness of dust and the huge coal tips (or coal heaps) close to the mining shaft (Figure 1). Colliery spoil, also known as mine- stone (Skarżyńska, 1995), is the typical leftover from coal extraction. The extracted amount of unused material can be of one ton of colliery spoil for each ton of coal (Wiggering, 1993). Typically, residues from the coal treatment are a waste (La Nauze and Duffy, 1985) which may be interesting to re-use. Thus, a thorough characteri- zation of what is found in a heap may yield some interesting prospects for potential applications. II. Materials and methods Thin sections were produced according to standards procedures (e.g. Humphries, 1992) and studied using a Leica DMR XP optical microscope. SEM- EDX has been carried out on a Hitachi S-4300SE/N SEM working in high vacuum mode, coupled to a Thermoscientific Ultradry EDX detector. Spoil heaps characteristics In order to understand the complex, unusual and highly variable mineralogy which results from the burning of coal heaps, it is necessary to present coal tips characteristics. A coal tip is a heap col- lecting all the leftovers from the coal exploitation: sterile rocks (sandstones, arkoses, shales. . . : Figure 2) which may contain organic matter and various by-products (old metallic elements such as railways, demolition wastes, fly ashes. . . ). Historically, the first heaps were flat shaped and did not reach im- portant heights because the leftovers were simply thrown by man from wagons. The separation pro- cesses were not very efficient and thus old heaps are still rich in coal (Limacher, 1963) and are thus more likely to be affected by burning. Technical pro- gresses led to the elevation of typical cone-shaped heaps using conveyor belt systems. Moreover, im- provements in the washing of coal led to an im- poverishment of the coal dust rate in coal heaps. 71 Thiéry & Guy Figure 1: Typical conic coal tips from the North of France (Loos-en-Gohelle). The two tips at the background, known as the “twin tips” are among the highest in Europe and culminate at ca. 130 meters above the surrounding plain. At the foreground lies a quarry corresponding to the emplacement of two former tips; both unburnt (black) and burnt (red, at the foreground of the heap) colliery spoil is exploited. Colliery spoil production can account for half of the production of a mine (Wiggering, 1993). For example, in Britain, at the dawn of the eighties, there were 3000 million tons of colliery spoil avail- able, with a production rate of 56 million tons/year (Sherwood, 1979). Spoil heaps combustion Apart from the provoked combustion of coal heaps in order to transform them into valorizable mate- rials (see below); the combustion of a coal heap occurs generally accidentally. Lightning strikes, a nearby forest fire are frequent cases but there is also the case of electrical short-circuit in underground cables (Nichol and Tovey, 1998). Spontaneous combustion of carbon-rich residues, and thermal input by the exothermic oxidation of pyrite are the inner phenomenon. Moreover, the poorly compacted nature of a coal heap will facili- tate air penetration in its deeper parts. Moldiness on wood fragments, tissue residues. . . can also account for an increase in temperature (Limacher, 1963). It has been estimated in the Nord-Pas-de- Calais basin that one heap out of three ignited, which, in the early eighties, meant 74 burning heaps (Ghouzi, 1982). In any case, ignition of coal heap fires is a complex phenomenon, described and dis- cussed by Misz-Kennan & Fabiańska (2011). Petrography Figure 2: Synthetic log presenting rocks accompanying coal in a deposit, which will typically be disposed as waste after coal exploitation (after Skarżyńska, 1995). 72 In the inner parts of a burning coal heap, temper- ature can exceed 1000 C and even reach 1300 C (Grapes, 2006; Guy et al., 2001; Sokol et al., 2002), at an almost ambient pressure. At such tempera- tures, mineralogical transformations are likely to occur. This phenomenon is known as pyrometamor- phism, more specifically “anthropogenic pyrometa- morphism” (Grapes, 2006). In the Russian literature as well as in eastern Europe it is common to name this as “combustion metamorphism” (Sokol, 2005; Žáček et al., 2014). The terminology of baked rocks and products formed during the combustion of coal tips is quite confusing and sometimes contradictory. Red, un- melted baked rocks are termed “clinker” or “glassy clinker” when they are melted but they do not display evidence of flow (Grapes et al., 2009). “Par- alavas” are melted vesicular rocks and can show some evidences of flow (Grapes et al., 2011). Thus, due to both an extreme variability within the initial products, the nature (melted or not) and the heat and atmosphere variability within the burn- ing heap, extremely contrasted products can be found in burnt colliery spoil (Figure 3). 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Unmelted, baked and annealed rocks In the simplest cases, the thermal transformations affecting the rocks from the heap will consist on a “baking” during which the initial texture (shale, sandstone) is preserved. This can be very spectacu- lar in the cases where fossils are preserved. Many similarities can be found between the baking of argillites or shales and brick production (Grapes, 2006). Typically, baked shales, argillites or sand- stones, will be macroscopically similar to what they were before baking: bedding is preserved (Figure 4 a, b). Investigations under optical microscope using moderate magnifications are in good agree- ment with this macroscopic observation. However, under higher magnifications, the matrix appears very close to that of bricks (Ingham, 2011) and fired clays (Figure 4c). Mica flakes are affected by the heating and coexist with a diffusive glassy matrix in which iron oxides are abundant (Figure 4d). material which vary within meters, and also on the type of gas resulting from the burning of the heap. Paralava’s aspect is typically very close to that of a natural lava, hence its name (Fermor, 1918). Various types can occur but they are typically vesic- ular with a ropy aspect. In the samples from the present study, the porosity can be very high, ca. half of the material consists of vesicles (Figure 5a). The microtexture reveals that a large part of the material is glassy; in this matrix, some minerals can be observed. Skeletal, slightly green spinel (Figure 5b, c) is associated with elongated (up to 150-200 micrometers long) mullite needles (Figure 5c, d and Figure 6a). The glass composition, revealed by EDX analysis, is rich is Si and Al with slight amounts of K, Ca, Na, Mg and Fe (Figure 6b). Exception made of Fe, this composition is quite close to that of a felspdar. EDX analysis on spinel crystal (Figure 6c) ca. 10 micrometers across reveals that this is an Al-Fe-Mg spinel, i.e. hercynite- spinel s.s. Melted rocks: paralavas Melted rocks from burnt spoil heaps are termed “paralavas”, sometimes they are also referred to as “parabasalts” when their chemistry is close to that of a basalt (Sharygin et al., 1999). They are very complex rocks, their composition, and thus their mineralogy, is dependent on the initial type of III. Use of colliery spoil Colliery spoil, available in huge amounts in coal mining areas, has been for a long time considered as a waste to reuse (La Nauze and Duffy, 1985). This concern the global material contained in the coal Figure 3: Macroscopic samples from various localities. a) baked sandstone, Rieulay, North of France; b) baked argillite, same provenance; c) preserved fossil leaves on a baked shale, Germignies, North of France; d) porous paralava with flow texture, Rieulay, North of France; e) ropy paralava, la Ricamarie, center of France; f) extremely vacuolar paralava, same provenance. 73 Thiéry & Guy Figure 4: Baked argillite, exact location unknown, North of France. a) general view (scan of a thin section); b) microscopic view plane polarized light, showing the preserved bedding; c) microtexture consisting mainly of quartz grains in a more or less fused fire clay matrix, crossed polarized light; d) detail of the matrix showing indistinct grain boundaries between quartz and fired clay. Poorly preserved clayey flakes are visible and show weak birefringence. The glassy matrix contains abundant iron oxides. tips, both burnt and unburnt. This all-in material has served to infill former mining works (galleries, pits. . . ), sometimes along with lime and fly ash (Ghataora and Jarvis, 1996; Karfakis et al., 1996). Prospects for a more general use of colliery spoil, regardless of its burnt or unburnt nature, include embankments, foundations (Ferreras Cadierno et al., 2014), and, mixed with Portland cement, only materials for which minor mechanical strength is needed seems to be achievable (Okagbue and Ochu- lor, 2007). However, the special nature of burnt colliery spoil has also attracted civil engineers because of its hard- ness. Thus, its potential use as an aggregate in concrete have been investigated (Runguphan and Guthrie, 2009). Those authors, using a substitution of natural aggregates with 60 % of burnt colliery spoil, have achieved a concrete showing a 39 MPa of unconfined compressive strength at 56 days. Some prospects may be found in the very special Figure 5: Some examples of the microtexture from a paralava, la Ricamarie, France. a) general view (scan of a thin section) illustrating the high porosity of the rock; b: dendritic spinel (Spl) crystals in a glassy (Gl) matrix, plane polarized light; c) elongated mullite (Mul) crystals, confirmed by EDX analysis (plane polarized light); d) elongated mullite crystals (crossed polarized light). 74 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 6: EDX spectra for a) mullite, b) glass and c) spinel from the glassy paralava. case of paralavas. Those ones being more or less amorphous and rich in Si and Al may potentially be interesting candidates for geopolymerization or any kind of alkali activation. Finally, it is worth mentioning a very famous use of crushed burnt colliery spoil: it is indeed used on tennis courts (the famous red sand), the Rolland-Garros court having been supplied by a former quarry in the North of France (Robaszynski and Guyétant, 2010).

New discoveries and their applications have taken place in different fields, such as electronics, chemistry, biology and physics. Some innovative nanoproducts have become available also for the conservation of cultural heritage (e.g. nano-Ca(OH) 2 , nano-SiO 2 , nano-TiO 2 , CNTs, etc.), showing interesting potentialities and advantages. However, there are also drawbacks. Extensive literature is available on nanolimes, i.e. colloidal alcoholic dispersions of Ca(OH) 2 nanoparticles, which are promising materials for the consolidation of lime-based plasters and calcareous stone, often present in ancient masonry structures. Nanolimes have several advantages such as high stability, fast carbonation rate and good chemical and physical compatibility with calcareous stone and lime-based plasters. However, in comparison to other existing consolidant products, like TEOS-based (Tetraethylorthosilicate), the penetration depth of nanolime is often limited, which may consequently result in a low effectiveness. The research presented in this paper aimed at understanding the penetration and deposition process of nanolime when applied in Maastricht limestone, a soft, highly porous substrate, widely used in the Dutch and Belgian provinces of Limburg. This research focused on the nanolime transport process to clarify whether nanolime is able to penetrate and deposit in depth in the material or if it simply accumulates near the surface. In order to investigate the distribution and particle size of nanolime deposited in the stone, next to simple phenolphthalein tests, optical microscopy, AFM and SEM-EDS were used. On the basis of the obtained results, the transport and deposition of a commercial nanolime in Maastricht limestone has been elucidated. The comprehension of the nanolime transport mechanism (penetration and distribution) within the treated material is crucial for improving the effectiveness of this consolidation treatment. Keywords: Nanolime, Consolidation products, Transport, Penetration depth, Limestone I. Introduction Calcareous stone (e.g. limestone) and lime-based finishes (e.g. renders, plasters and mural paint- ing) are often subjected to several degradation pro- cesses (e.g. salt crystallization, frost action, biolog- ical growth); these factors that can lead to decay patterns i.e. powdering, sanding, scaling or chalk- ing (Figure 1a,b). Interventions on these kinds of historical sub- strates anyway differ significantly; different theo- retical approaches and practical recommendations are found in the European context. A restoration, meant recover the loss of cohesion of materials, can include pre-consolidation (to avoid material loss in the following phases), cleaning (e.g. by poultice methods or laser ablation) and desalination (e.g. with poultice methods). These processes are generally followed by the application of a consolidant, which can recover the lost cohesion; consolidation can easily stabilize su- perficial decay forms as powdering, sanding and chalking; pathologies as exfoliation, scaling or flak- ing can generally not be treated. Consolidants are usually applied to stone, ren- ders or plasters by brush, spray or by immersion and penetrate into the treated material by capillary action (Doehne 2010). Anyway the application of a consolidant is a physically irreversible treatment and is therefore a critical treatment that has to be properly studied and well conceived. Consolida- tion is in fact a risky operation and it is not difficult to find situations where consolidation has left a negative imprint and serious drawbacks (Delgado 2010). A consolidation treatment should guarantee three fundamental requirements: effectiveness (i.e. im- provement of the mechanical strength) compatibil- 77 Borsoi et al. Figure 1: (a) Loss of cohesion, powdering and traces of past interventions are visible in this masonry of Maastricht Limestone (Keverborg castle, Kessel, The Netherlands); b) detachment, loss of cohesion and material in coloured lime-based mortars applied on historical stone masonry (Alcantâra Convent, Lisbon, Portugal) ity (with the treated substrate) and long term dura- bility (resistance to different damage mechanisms) (Hansen, 2003; Toniolo, 2010; Van Hees, 2014). The concept of compatibility of an intervention has nowa- days replaced that of reversibility (Teutonico, 1997; Van Hees, 2014). Products used for conservation issues should be compatible, from the mechanical, chemical physical and aesthetical point of view, with the substrate on which they are applied. Inorganic lime-based consolidants are in theory more suitable for limestone than the organic ones (as TEOS-based consolidants), because of their bet- ter compatibility [ Doehne 2010 ] . The historically most known inorganic lime-based consolidant prod- uct is limewater, a Ca(OH) 2 aqueous solution. Lime- water, however, has a poor penetration depth and effectiveness, because of the low solubility of cal- cium in water. Alternatives to limewater have been explored over the last decade, as the use of alcoholic dis- persions of calcium hydroxide nanoparticles, com- monly known as nanolimes (Giorgi, 2000; Dei, 2006). Nanolimes are colloidal alcoholic dispersions with high stability and high lime concentration, facts that in theory would improve the consolidating ac- tion (Chelazzi, 2013; Ziegenbalg, 2010). Nanolimes are usually synthesized under controlled conditions by homogeneous phase reaction (Salvadori, 2001; Dei, 2006) or solvothermical reaction (Favaro, 2008; Ziegenbalg, 2010; Poggi, 2012). Calcium hydroxide nanoparticles have a size between 50 and 600 nm. This lime-based colloidal dispersion has been ap- plied in conservation for the pre-consolidation and for the recovery of the superficial cohesion (Am- brosi, 2001; Dei, 2006; Poggi, 2012; Borsoi, 2012; Baglioni, 2013; Chelazzi, 2013; Rodriguez-Navarro, 2013, Carretti, 2014). However, when mass con- solidation is required, as in the case of render or stone, the potential of nanolimes is still questioned (Campbell, 2010; Hull, 2012). One of the reasons of the limited effectiveness of these products is the accumulation of nanolime at or just beneath the drying surface (often with the formation of a white patina) (Ghaffari, 2012; Costa, 2011). Figure 2: Specimen set up and relative sampling spots; TA: absorption and drying perferomed on the same side; TB: absorption on one side (then sealed), drying on the opposite side. 78 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands In order to improve the consolidation effect in depth, the transport mechanism and the deposition of nanolimes within porous materials, as stone or renders, should be better understood. Nanolime transport mechanism has not been systematically studied yet. Does nanolime accumulate at the sur- face during absorption or is it able to penetrate in depth in the material, but it migrates back to the surface during the drying process? What is the role of nanolime stability and nanoparticles aggregation phenomena in nanolime deposition in a treated material? This research aimed at clarifying the transport and deposition mechanisms of nanolime in porous materials. The transport of a commercial nanolime product was studied on Maastricht limestone, a high porosity yellowish limestone. The absorption and drying behaviour of nanolime was measured and compared to that of ethanol (the dispersant of this nanolime commercial product) and water (section 3.2). Next to simple phenolphthalein tests on cross sections (section 3.3), microscopy obser- vations by AFM (section 3.1), optical microscopy (3.4) and SEM-EDS (3.5) were performed; the pur- pose is to investigate nanolime penetration depth and deposition within the material as result of the transport mechanism. II. Materials and methods Substrate The Maastricht limestone is an almost pure cal- careous building material ( ⇡ 95% CaCO 3 ) (Nijland, 2006), quarried in the Belgian and Dutch provinces of Limburg (Dubelaar, 2006). It has high poros- ity (45-50%) and unimodal pore distribution (35-40 µm). Those characteristics, combined with a weak cementation, lead to some unbelief with respect to its use as a major good-quality building stone (Dreesen, 2004). A large number of historical buildings have in- deed been built almost exclusively with this mate- rial and have remained rather unaffected after cen- turies of environmental exposure (Dreesen, 2004; Van Hees, 2009). Its durability is possibly linked to the dissolution and re-precipitation of carbonates within the limestone pores network, when exposed to atmospheric agents (Dusar, 2003). This process was traditionally enhanced by the application of limewater (kalkwei), which forms a sort of durable protective layer (Dreesen, 2004). Despite its good durability, this material may in some cases show decay in the form of loss of cohesion of the surface (Figure 1a) (Nijland, 2006). Nanolime The commercial nanolime CaloSil E25 (IBZ, Ger- many), reported in the text just as E25, has been tested. This colloidal dispersion has a calcium hydroxide nanoparticles concentration of 25 g/l and is dispersed in ethanol. E25 is obtained by solvothermical reaction of metallic calcium in water or alcohols (e.g. ethanol, propanol, isopropanol). Nanoparticles have hexagonal plate-like shape and size ranges between 50 and 250 nm (Ziegenbalg, 2010). Before use, E25 was placed in an ultrasonic bath (60 Hz) for 10 minutes, to minimize nanoparti- cle aggregation phenomena. Ethanol (p.a. > 99.5%, by Sigma Aldrich) and distilled water (conductivity < 2 µs/cm) were used for comparison with the E25. Absorption and drying tests Maastricht limestone core specimens (4 cm height, 4 cm diameter), drilled from sound blocks, were used for the capillary absorption and drying mea- surements. The capillary absorption and drying were measured for E25 as well as for ethanol and water. The specimens were sealed on the lateral side with parafilm in order to prevent evaporation on these sides. The capillary absorption was measured by partially immersing the specimens in a petri dish, filled with nanolime, ethanol or water. The weight of the core specimens was measured at regular in- tervals during the absorption process till saturation was reached, and the height of the wetting front was monitored and photographically recorded. Wa- ter, ethanol and nanolimes absorption were carried out in sequence on the same specimens, in order to minimize the effect of the stone variability. The drying behavior of specimens saturated with nanolime, ethanol and water was evaluated by mea- suring the weight loss over time. Both absorp- tion and drying measurements were performed in threefold and under controlled conditions (50% RH, T=20 C, air speed < 0,1 m/s). Additionally, in the case of nanolime, in order to clarify if any nanolime accumulation at the absorp- tion surface occurs during absorption or drying, the absorption and drying were repeated according to two different test procedures, as shown in Fig- ure 2. In one case (specimen TA), the drying was performed on the same side of the absorption (as it normally occurs in the practice of conservation); in the other case (specimen TB) the drying was performed through the surface opposite to the ab- sorption surface (which was sealed after specimen saturation with nanolime). 79 Borsoi et al. Phenolphthalein test The penetration of the lime nanoparticles immedi- ately after absorption was assessed by phenolph- thalein test. After complete saturation, the cross section of the specimen was nebulized with a 1% phenolphthalein solution in ethanol and water. Phe- nolphthalein is a pH indicator that turns purple when pH conditions are higher than 9,8. In this case a purple color of the substrate, treated with phenolphthalein, indicates the presence of nanolime (Ca(OH) 2 , pH E25 > 11). By comparing the results of the phenolphthalein test with the photographical observations of the wetting front, conclusion can be drawn on possible phase separation between dis- persant (in this case ethanol) and nanolime particles during absorption. The phenolphthalein test was performed on the specimens saturated with nanolime also during the drying process (at 1, 4, 8, 24 and 48h), in order to understand nanolime migration within the material. Drying tests were performed both in atmospheric and in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, in order to check the relevance of nanolime carbonation during the drying period. A N2 Boy nitrogen gas-supplying device, by Taitec, was used to create a nitrogen-rich atmosphere within a glass desiccator, where treated specimens were stored. Microstructural observations AFM A TT-AFM device was used to characterize E25 samples; the aim of this analysis was to verify the morphology of the nanoparticles and possible ag- gregation phenomena, that can affect the transport of nanolime. Nanolime was diluted in its pure ethanol and after several trials a dilution of 1:100 (in volume, that is a concentration of 0.25 g/l of nano- Ca(OH) 2 in ethanol) was considered as suitable for AFM analysis. An amount of 5?l was dropped with a micropipette on the freshly cleaved mica substrate (sample holder). Images were aquired in vibration using silicon tips (Brucker model NCHV) and both topographic and phase images were processed. The equipment allows a measurement of the surface topography with a high precision up to nanometric scale. Optical Microscopy The drying surface and the cross section of the specimens treated with nanolime were observed with a stereomicroscope Zeiss Stemi SV 11. Images were recorded with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 digital microscopy camera. The AxioVision 4.8 software and its interactive measurement tools were used to record and analyse the specimens. 80 SEM-EDS The cross-section of the specimens treated with nanolime were studied by SEM-EDS; the equipment (Nova NanoSEM 650, by FEI) is coupled with a low vacuum solid-state detector BSED (GAD) which al- lows high resolution imaging (up to 1,4 nm) and a high flexibility of the working conditions (1 to 30kV). Samples were collected, at the end of the drying, in the most representative spots (top, mid- dle, bottom) of both specimens types (TA and TB), as seen in Figure 2. III. Results Nanolime characterization by AFM The observation of E25 by AFM clarifies the particle size of nanolime and aggregation phenomena in the dried phase. Figure 3a shows a heterogeneous distribution of nanolime and a high polidispersivity of the nanoparticle aggregates (with different size and shape); the size of these clusters range from few nanometers to more than 10 µm. Figure 3b and 3c show that clusters are formed by nano (30-100 nm) and sub-micrometric(up to 400 nm) lime particles; the hexagonal plate-like shape, typically observed for these type of nanoparticle (Salvadori, 2001), is possibly deformed by dragging effect originated by the weak absorption of the lime nanoparticle on the mica sample holder (Ambrosi, 2001), and /or to the fraction exerter by the scanning of the AFM tip. Lime nanoparticles, when the alcoholic solvent has completely evaporated, tend then to form clus- ters; these aggregation phenomena are an impor- tant factor that can affect the deposition of nanolime clusters within the treated material. When considering the liquid phase (nanoparticle dispersed in the alcoholic solvent), diffuse electrical double layer repulsive interactions would prevent nanoparticle aggregation, at least in diluted dis- persions (Rodriguez-Navarro, 2005). Furthermore the low dielectric constant of a low-polarity sol- vent as ethanol can guarantee a stable dispersion. However lime nanoparticles tend spontaneously to aggregate and attractive Van der Waals forces will keep particles attached once agglomeration has taken place. As argued by Chekli (2013), a particle size concentration dependence at nanoparticle con- centrations above 0,05 mg/L has to be considered; when nanoparticle concentration is relevant, like in our case (25g/l), the distance between nanoparticles in the sample is reduced; this presumably increases the chance of collision between particles and hence, their aggregation. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 3: a) Topographical view (50x50 µm 2 ) by AFM of nanolime clusters in the dried phase with different shape and size; zooom on specific spots: a) topography and b) AFM image of two clusters of E25, formed by the aggregation of lime nanoparticle. Absorption and drying kinetics Figure 4a shows the capillary absorption curve of water, ethanol and E25. All these liquids saturate the sample in less than 5 minutes, due to the coarse porosity of Maastricht limestone. When comparing the behaviour of the different liquids, water absorption is faster than ethanol and E25 absorption. Comparing pure ethanol and E25, a slower absorption is measured for E25. This is due to lime nanoparticles (25g/l), which modify the density (and therefore viscosity) and possibly affect the surface tension of the alcoholic solvent; this af- fects the capillary transport. Duan (2011) points out that nanoparticle agglomeration, that easily takes place as seen in the previous section, can affect the viscosity of the dispersion and therefore the absorption of the dispersion. When considering the drying behavior (Fig- ure 4b), the evaporation rate of water is much slower (up to 7 days for complete drying) than that of ethanol (complete drying in 48-72h) or nano- lime (up to 72h). The faster evaporation of ethanol can be easily explained by its lower boiling point (78,37 C) compared to that of water ( ⇡ 100 C). Moreover the superficial tension of water (3 times higher than that of ethanol) can explain the higher water retention within the Maastricht pore network. In the drying curves two stages can be observed. In the 1 st stage of drying, called the constant drying period, the drying front is at the surface and the drying rate is constant (Hall, 2012). This first phase ends after 24h in the case of the alcoholic solution (EtOH and E25), while for water it is approximately at 96h. In the 2 nd stage of drying, called the falling drying rate period and identified by the change in the slope of the drying curve, the liquid content can no longer support the demands of the evaporation flux. In this stage transport occurs in the vapor phase; thus lime nanoparticles cannot physically take part in the process and are deposited in the material before the end of the 1 st stage. It is thus important to observe the deposition of nanolime at 24h, which corresponds to the end of the 1 st stage. By comparing the drying curves of ethanol and nanolime, a slight delay in the drying of the mate- rial is observed in the case of E25. Nanolime does not hinder significantly the drying kinetic but a partial occlusion of the pores, caused by the forma- tion of a nanolime layer during drying, could have delayed the evaporation of the solvent. Phenolphthalein test Phenolphthalein test was performed as described in section 2.4, immediately after complete saturation of the specimens with nanolime at standard condi- tions in air (50% RH, 20oC) and in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere. Nanolime has penetrated the whole depth of the specimen (40 mm), as shown in figure 5a. No accumulation of nanolime at the absorption surface is macroscopically visible immediately after specimen imbibition. By analysing the specimens stored in a nitrogen- rich atmosphere, it is observed that nanolime is stable and homogeneously distributed within the cross section during the first 8 h of drying (Figure 5b,c). At 24 h, a remarkable amount of nanolime is visible nearby the drying surface, whereas just traces are detected in the outer 10 mm beneath the 81 Borsoi et al.

Further microscopical details are presented in the next section. Microstructural observations by optical mi- croscopy In order to clarify nanolime transport and depo- sition within limestone pores network, specimen type TA and TB (described in section 2.3) were characterized by optical microscopy. In Figure 6 stereomicroscope microphotographs of the cross sections of specimens TA and TB, ob- served after complete drying ( ⇡ 72h), are shown. In both cases nanolime accumulates at 0,5-0,7 mm beneath the drying surface. No deposition of nano- lime can be identified at the absorption surface of TB. Observations on specimen TB clarify that nano- lime penetrates in the material without any accumu- lation at the absortion surface during the absorption phase. No phase separation between the particles and the solvent is observed during the absorption process in this stone. At the same time, traces of nanolime are observed in depth in both specimens, as visible in Figure 7a and 7b. Nanoparticle tends to aggregate. Reduced amount of nanolime are indeed visible in the entire section of both specimens. The specimens analyzed in section 3.3 (phenolph- thalein test) were observed more in detail by optical microcopy (Figure 8a,b); no white deposition was macroscopically identified on the dying surface, but nanolime formed a thin layer beneath the dry- ing surface (at 0,5 mm in depth, Figure 8a,b). The solvent, by evaporating, flows in the direction of the drying surface and nanoparticles partially mi- grate with the solvent, depositing just beneath the drying surface. This accumulation of nanolime is remarkable at the complete saturation of the solvent (48-72h); this evidence can confirm that nanolime is gradually moving back to the surface with its solvent during drying. Although most of the nanolime is accumulated just beneath the drying surface, small and heteroge- neously distributed amounts of nanolime particles are also observed in depth (20 to 40 mm). Figure 5: Pictures of the phenolphthalein test performed on the cross sections of specimens treated with E25 (and observed a) immediately after saturation (in air at 50% RH, T=20 C), with complete saturation of the specimen (arrow); specimens were then stored in a N 2 chamber and observed at b) 4h, c) 8h and d) 24h during drying (each cross section has been obtained by breaking the specimen at the given time and drying surface is on the top of the specimen); a layer of nanolime is visible at 0,5 mm beneath the drying surface (arrows). 82 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 6: Microphotographs of the limestone cross section in proximity of the drying surface of a) TA and b) TB; in both cases nanolime is accumulated in a thin layer near the drying surface. Microstructural observations by SEM-EDS Microstructural observations and microanalyses were performed by SEM-EDS in order to further study the deposition of nanolime within limestone. The cross sections of specimens TA and TB were observed. In both cases, samples were collected from the middle of the specimen, and at the absorp- tion/drying surfaces (Figure 2). The SEM observations of specimen TA show a significant deposition of nanolime at 0,5 mm be- neath the drying surface (Figure 9a, 9b); the rel- ative EDS spectra ( 9c) highlights the presence of large amounts of carbonated nanolime (CaCO 3 ). Nanoparticles have mainly hexagonal plate-like shape and dimension between 30 to 100 nm. Due to random Brownian motion and attractive short- range van der Waals forces, nanoparticles have mainly agglomerate in clusters (Figure 9b). In fact, similar strong aggregation phenomena are reported in literature for particle size of 1-100 nm, resulting in clusters of typical size 0,1-10 µm (Gaurav, 2009). Significant deposition of nanoparticles is visible up to 10 mm in depth from the absorption/drying surface; the nanolime particles have deposited fill- ing voids and pores. Pores with diameter of 1 to 5 µm are easily filled with the nanoconsolidant. Next to the accumulation of nanoparticles clus- ters near the drying surface, local depositions of isolated nanolime particles are visible almost every- where in the observed specimen section. Deeper in the stone, at 20 mm from the absorption/drying surface, only sporadic deposits of nanolime par- ticles are observed, heterogeneously distributed (Figure 9d, 9e). At 30 to 40 mm in depth from the drying surface, the presence of nanoparticles (Figure 9f, 9g) is very limited. When considering the particle size of the nano- lime deposits in the cross section, it can be observed that the size of the nanoparticle is smaller (30 to 100 nm) at the drying surface than in depth in the mate- rial (150 to 300 nm). This suggests that smaller lime nanoparticle are back-transported more easily to the drying surface, meanwhile bigger nanoparticles (70 to 300 nm) deposit preferentially in depth. The SEM-EDS analysis of specimen TB shows significant nanolime deposition at 0,5 mm beneath the drying surface (Figures 10a, 10b). Nanolime is visible as well at 10 mm in depth; nanolime de- position is decreasing gradually with depth, with local clusters visible up to 20-25 mm (Figures 10c, 10d). At 35 to 40 mm in depth, in proximity of the absorption surface, some sporadic accumula- tions of nanoparticles are locally visible (Figure 10e). Nanoparticles have in some cases a tetragonal mor- phology (Figure 10f), which is typically attributed to aragonite, a thermodynamically unstable poly- morph of calcium carbonate. Figure 7: Microphotographs of the limestone cross section: a) traces of nanolime at 20 mm in depth in specimen TA; b) reduced amount of nanolime at 25 mm in depth in specimen TB. 83 Borsoi et al. Figure 8: Microphotographs of specimens treated with E25, stored in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere and observed at a) 24h and b) after complete drying (48 to 72h) in a N2 rich atmosphere. A layer of nanolime is visible at 0,5 mm in depth in the drying surface. These observations demonstrate that the accumu- lation of nanoparticles, observed at the absorption surface in specimen TA, is not due to reduced pen- etration and accumulation of the nanoparticles at the absorption surface during absorption, but to mi- gration together with the solvent during the drying phase. These results definitely confirm the obser- vations carried out with phenolphthalein, showing migration of the nanoparticles during drying. As observed in TA, also in the case of TB the size of nanoparticle is smaller (30 to 60 nm) at the drying surface and considerably larger (70 to 300 nm) in depth. IV. Conclusion This paper clarifies the transport of nanolime within Maastricht limestone, a highly porous calcareous material. The results show that a colloidal dis- persion of lime nanoparticles in ethanol (CaloSil E25) can easily penetrate in depth in this material without any accumulation at the absorption surface during the absorption phase. Nano and submicron particles (up to 400 nm) can widely fit in the lime- stone porosity (mean pore size of 35 ?µ). However it appears that accumulation just underneath the sur- face occurs during drying, when the solvent moves back to the drying surface, depositing an important part of the nanolime particles. It was observed that the size of the nanoparticles Figure 9: SEM microphotographs of specimen TA at different depths in the cross section (from the drying surface); analysis of sample At at a) 0,5 mm and b) 1,7 mm and c) its relative EDS spectra; analysis of sample Am at d) 20 mm and e) 22 mm; analysis of sample Ab at f) 30 mm and g) 35 mm in depth. 84 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 10: SEM microphotographs of specimen TB at different depths in the cross section (from the drying surface); analysis of sample Bt at a) 0,5 mm and b) 1 mm, with a remarkable accumulation of nanolime; analysis of sample Bm at d) 20 mm and e) 22 mm, with sporadic amounts of nanolime; analysis of sample Bb at f) 32 mm and g) 35 mm, where some lime nanoparticle clusters are visible. determine the location of their deposition in the stone: smaller lime nanoparticle (30 to 60 nm) much easily migrate back during drying and precipitate in clusters in the proximity of the drying surface, whereas some of the bigger nanoparticles (70 to 400 nm) deposit in depth, Because of the fast absorption of this coarse porous stone, phase separation between solvent and nanoparticles does hardly take place during absorption; only a small amount of nanoparticles, generally those of large size, is deposited in depth in the material. Aggregation phenomena, which take place in the dispersion mostly due to Brownian motions, favour the formation of clusters; Van der Waals forces keep nanoparticles attached. Anyway these weak bonding phenomena do not guarantee a significant deposition of nanolime in depth in the material. Besides, the dense nanolime layer (accumulated beneath the drying surface) limits the consolidation effect in depth and the penetration of successive consolidant applications. These results suggest that in order to improve nanolime precipitation in depth, the transport and deposition mechanism of nanolime should be mod- ified. A more homogeneous nanoparticles distribution in depth might be obtained by modifying the prop- erties of the solvents. A solvent with slower drying rate and higher dielectric constant might be used to favor nanoparticle/solvent phase separation and induce nanoparticle deposition in depth. Next to solvent modification, the optimization of improved application strategies might help favor- ing nanolime precipitation in depth. Research is ongoing to verify these possibilities.

For a full characterization of these materials, the full scale-range needs to be analyzed, since all scales are important for the behavior of these materials. Laboratory based high-resolution X-ray CT (HRXCT, µ-CT) has become a mature and frequently used tool for the 3D characterization of many types of materials, including building materials (Cnudde et al., 2011; Cnudde et al., 2009; Cnudde and Boone, 2013; Lenoir et al., 2004; Rozenbaum, 2011). Despite its succes, there are some improtant shortfalls to the technique. Although sub-micron resolutions can be achieved at high-end systems, these systems are still far from standard, and some important sample-size trade-offs have to be made to achieve these resolutions. Especially in heterogeneous (geological) building materials, this leads to questions concerning representativity of samples. Furthermore, the acquired chemical information is usually limited to a relative value in terms of density and atomic number. We propose a workflow that combines multiple techniques to characterize structure and chemical composition of the Vosges sandstone, a heterogeneous, clay-rich sandstone consisting out of a mixture of quartz, feldspars and feldspars. µ-CT on samples of different sizes is combined with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, to gain additional information on both structure and chemistry of the stone. By using 2D and 3D image registration techniques, a pseudo-3D look into the distribution of different mineral phases is obtained, using a representative sample size. Next, focused ion beam nanotomography (FIB-nt; Holzer et al., 2004; Holzer and Cantoni, 2011; Keller et al., 2011) is used to investigate the clay mineral fraction, since these features cannot be resolved using µ-CT by the lack of resolution. The most important drawback of FIB-nt is its destructive nature, making it unsuitable for the analysis of dynamic processes such as water uptake, which are important in building materials. Therefore, a novel technique, ptychographic tomography (Diaz et al., 2012; Dierolf et al., 2010; Holler et al., 2014; Trtik et al., 2013), is demonstrated. This technique, possible at synchrotron facilities, enables 3D imaging of materials at resolutions up to 16 nm, in a non-destructive way. Ptychographic tomography opens the door for the dynamic imaging of processes at the nanoscale Keywords: SEM, micro-tomography, data fusion, ptychography, FIB-nt I. Introduction Analysis techniques based on imaging have always been important methods for the study of (geologi- cal) building materials. The most well-known and mature techniques to do this are optical microscopy (both in reflected or transmitted light mode and in fluorescent light mode) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These microscopic techniques provide 2D images, in which information on both the structure and composition of materials can be found, be it directly during the analysis (e.g. petro- graphical analysis) or later through post-processing the images (e.g. thresholding the porosity from SEM images; Marcelino et al., 2007; Prakongkep et al., 2010). When used together with energy disper- sive spectroscopy (EDS), SEM analysis can provide quantitative compositional data of the analyzed samples. During the last two decades, high resolu- tion X-ray tomography (µ-CT) has become a very valuable technique for the acquisition of 3D images of building materials; as a bonus, this technique images the internal structure of these materials in a non-destructive ways, allowing the study of dy- 87 each method, and to complement for the weaknesses of others.

Further- more, CT is capable of imaging a big range of sam- ple sizes, going from mm-scale microplugs to full- size, 10 cm diameter drill cores. Using this method, information on connectivity of the pore space, stack- ing of the grains, dissolution/precipitation pro- cesses, drying rate, etc. can be analyzed, all of which are highly important in building stone and concrete properties. Despite its obvious advantages, there are some fields in which µ-CT has to face defeat against the previously mentioned, more tra- ditional research techniques. In standard laboratory µ-CT setups, it is not possible to acquire exact chem- ical information about the sample, since the images acquired with CT are 3D distribution of the lin- ear attenuation coefficient of the samples interior, which depends on the atomic and density Figure number 1: Workflow for multi-scale analysis of Vosges sandstone sample.

The two different planes provide a pseudo-3D look at the orientation of the iron laminations. (Dierolf et al., 2010; Trtik et al., 2013). In CDI, the sample is hit by a narrow pencil X-ray beam, and unlike attenuation tomography, where only X-ray intensity is measured, the detector records maps of both the absorption and the diffraction patterns of X-rays. The diffraction pattern of the X-ray beam is measured at hundreds of (overlapping) positions in the sample for one particular position, allowing for a high-resolution 2D ptychographic reconstruction. In ptychographic tomography, this procedure is re- peated for a large number of angular intervals, and using dedicated algorithms, a 3D image is acquired. Ptychographic tomography has reached 3D reso- lutions of up to 16 nm (Holler et al., 2014), but as in most high-resolution techniques, the trade-off is that sample sizes are extremely small. In this study, several 50 µm diameter samples were imaged at a resolution of ± 100 nm, and two 25 µm diameter samples could be measured at a resolution of about 45 to 60 nm spatial resolution. Ptychographic exper- iments were carried out at the cSAXS beam line of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland (www.psi.ch). concentrations of dense inclusions could clearly be identified at this scale. To be able to do quantitative porosity and grain analysis, higher resolution was definitely needed. The reconstructed volume of the 1 mm microplug showed enough detail to allow a clear separation between porosity and grains. Grains could be sep- arated into dense minerals and quartz, clays and feldspars. Between the latter three mineral classes, some contrast was visible with the naked eye; how- ever, grey value segmentation was not possible be- tween these types. Elongated mica clay minerals, showing their typical cleavage, could clearly be identified on these high-resolution images. Poros- ity analysis of this dataset resulted in a porosity of 16.50 %, with only 0.2 % closed porosity. This points out that most connections between individual pores were captured at this resolution and valuable con- clusions about the pore space could be made for this sample. X-ray computed tomography The BSE images acquired gave contrast between quartz and feldspars, something that was absent in the low-resolution CT scan. Sadly, this contrast was not big enough to measure their relative content using image analysis software directly on the BSE images. The very heavy, bright minerals were in very large contrast to the rest of the mineral con- tent, but rather scarce in a random 2D plane. Point spectra taught us that the largest of these miner- als, which already showed up in the µ-CT scans, contained titanium and are probably titanite (TiO2). The acquired EDS maps revealed more detailed information on the distribution of different min- eral phases; three distributions were measured: For ease of reading, results of both tomography scans (high and lower resolutions) are put together, despite the fact that they do not follow each other in the chronology of the used workflow. The recon- structed slices of the µ-CT scan of the entire ‘large’ sample clearly indicated that a resolution of 8.9 µm was not enough to resolve all features of the Vosges sandstone clearly. Although one can have an idea of the overall structure and porosity, individual grains and pores could not be segmented and separated on this sample. However, regions or laminations with higher or lower porosity, or zones with higher 90 V. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands potassium, silicon and iron. The grains with the highest relative amount of silicon could be identified as quartz (SiO 2 ), potassium-rich grains are (KAlSi3O8) or clay minerals (e.g. muscovite: KAl 2 (AlSi 3 O 10 )(F,OH) 2 ). Places where there was iron pointed to the presence of iron oxides, which give the Vosges sandstone its color. The images indicated a rather uniform distribution of quartz, feldspars and clay minerals (from most to least abundant); however, the iron was mainly present in a distinct layer, running through two out of five imaged surfaces. It was clear that most of the iron was not present in big grains, but present in the cement that binds the grains together. The distinct, iron-rich layer that were observed in the SEM im- ages were not clearly visible in the CT-volume, nor were they easy to see in the BSE images. These results show that even BSE images do not always give a full idea about the number of minerals inside a sample, and that EDS analysis is useful, even if there are no different phases at first sight. Data fusion: CT-SEM-EDS The real strength of the proposed method lies in the combination of 3D information at various res- olutions, with good structural and chemical 2D information. 2D-to-2D image registration between SEM and EDS images provides grain-per-grain min- eralogical information, even when contrast in BSE images is too low (Figure 3). Some SEM machines are equipped to automatically overlay correspond- ing chemical information onto the SEM images, but since landmark based registration was used, the method is also suitable for merging with other imaging techniques (e.g. light microscopy, XRF mapping). Besides 2D-to-2D image registration methods, useful to merge 2D imaging techniques to each other, 2D-to-3D registration of this 2D information to a 3D image adds an extra dimension to planar image data. Due to various factors, this 2D-to-3D registration is not always straightforward and man- ual or semi-automatic registration is often the way to go. Problems that can arise are for instance the fact that SEM images have a depth of view, often an advantage, but a limiting factor in the auto- matic registration of SEM images to 2D slices from an image stack. Also detector position (possibly creating a skew in SEM images), unknown orienta- tion of images, etc. can provide difficulties in im- age registration. Using a semi-automatic landmark based registration technique, in which correspond- ing points in the reference and target image were selected, SEM/EDX images were first rotated into the same Z plane of the target surface. Next, im- ages only had to be translated in X and Y direction, together with a limited degree of warping to correct for distortion in the images For this final tweaking step, the bookstein image warp in algorithm Avizo Fire R was used (Bookstein, 1986). As a result of this 2D to 3D image registration, a pseudo-three-dimensional look at the distribution of different mineral phases is provided. This means that not only are the iron-rich laminations observed, they can now be oriented in space (Figure 4), and their orientation can be compared to that of other features inside the stone. A next and final type of image registration is the registration of the reconstructed microplug CT scan to the larger CT scan of the base sample (3D-to-3D registration). This is an important step, since ge- ological materials like the Vosges sandstone, but also other construction materials such as concrete and bricks, are heterogeneous in nature. Therefore, it is important that one can pinpoint the location of a sub-sample, especially if this is very small (in this case, < 1 mm), since the properties derived from this one microplug might not be represen- tative for the entire sample. As in the 2D-to-3D registration step, semi-automatic landmark registra- tion was performed to create the alignment between the small and large 3D volume. Figure 5 shows the importance of this last image registration step. The small microplug is indicated in red inside the larger sample, which has been partially made transparent. The sample contains areas where more or less high- density minerals are present, and porosity is not the same throughout the entire sample. Indication of the location of the first subsample can help to set a strategy for further subsampling, or to determine which zones in the sample will have the same (flow) parameters as the microplug. Figure 5: Location of the microplug (Ø = 1 mm) in the full sample (width = 14 mm). Full sample has been made partially transparent to show variance in dense mineral distribution. 91 de Boever et al. Figure 6: Left: BSE image of clay-rich area inside the Vosges sandstone; Right: FIB-nt slice of a similar area inside the stone. Different structures can clearly be adsorbed, but not automatically quantified due to low contrast. VI. Focused ion beam nanotomography Using FIB-nt, particular zones of interest could be selected and analyzed at very high resolution in 3D. Figure 6 shows a BSE image of an area consist- ing out of fine clay minerals, which could not be resolved using µ-CT. Using the FIB and electron beam, a 17 ⇥ 17 ⇥ 10 µm 3 volume was imaged, at a resolution of 16 nm. Due to the non-conductivity of the material, a lot of charging artifacts were present, and contrast was low. The images gave a nice in- dication and view to the microstructure of the clay minerals; however, it was not possible to do any type of quantitative image analysis on them. Fur- ther experiments with serial sectioning, combined with backscattered electron imaging will be per- formed in the near future. This will reduce charg- ing of the sample, and additionally create a higher contrast between pores and grains. VII. Ptychographic tomography Several samples were analyzed and a first exper- imental sequence imaged 50 µm samples with a voxel size of 34 nm, and a corresponding spatial resolution of 89 to 120 nm in 3D. During a later beam time, two 25 µm sized samples were mea- sured using the setup described in Holler et al. (2014), achieving a spatial resolution of 45 nm (voxel size 17 nm) and 60 nm (voxel size 21 nm) in 3D. The resulting images were very sharp and show excel- lent contrast between pores and grains. The images provide quantitative data about the electron density at any given point in the sample, meaning that dif- ferent mineral phases were clearly distinguishable in the sample. Figure 7 shows a reconstructed slice of a 25 µm small fragment of mica minerals, at a spatial resolu- tion of 45 nm. The results show that ptychographic tomography is a very promising technique in the 92 geosciences, providing unique and unseen images of a material’s microstructure. It can however never be used as a single technique, since representative- ness of the extremely small samples will never be enough to characterize an entire material. VIII. Conclusion Neither µ-CT, SEM, EDS, FIB-nt and ptychographic tomography can prove themselves as a perfect, all- area characterization technique for geological build- ing materials. However, a combination of some or all of these methods strengthens them and gives more complete results on porosity, chemical com- position and grain sizes inside the material. Of the used methods, µ-CT is probably the most universal and flexible technique to measure porosities and grain sizes, across different scales, especially if dif- ferent samples and subsamples are analyzed. The strength of having three-dimensional results, the fact that the technique has matured a lot over the past decades, and the rapid progress of computing power for analysis enables excellent and quantita- tive data using CT. However, for very small features and for additional chemical information, data fu- sion with other techniques is a necessity. For the first case, relatively new techniques as FIB-nt and ptychographic tomography can be used. Although these methods provide very high-resolution images about a material’s microstructure, they can only analyze very small volumes. Since these analyzed volumes are usually smaller than (part of) the grains and pores of the materials of interest, they can never be used as the only analysis technique for geolog- ical building materials. The destructive nature of FIB-nt will sometimes create issues, since dynamic processes cannot be analyzed, a problem that is not present in ptychographic imaging. Chemical information can be derived from EDS analysis, com- bined with backscattered electron imaging. EDS has the advantage of being quite fast, so relatively large 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 7: Reconstructed slice through a mica mineral sample, derived from the Vosges sandstone (resolution = 45 nm; voxel size = 17 nm) surfaces can be analyzed, if images are stitched together. Characterization of rocks, concrete, mortars and bricks using image-based techniques will always remain a multi-scale problem. Thus, several sam- ples of different sizes need to be analyzed using different methods. But, if sample selection and methodology are done correctly, these image-based techniques can provide fantastic data, in which po- sition and orientation of certain characteristics and parameters can be perfectly located.

St Marys / Canada Building Materials ⇤ alireza.dehghan@mail.utoronto.ca Abstract In southern Ontario, the premium coarse aggregate sources for concrete construction are quarried from the Niagara Escarpment Amabel and Lockport dolostone formations. As access to this resource becomes more and more restricted, alternative limestone formations are being utilized by the construction industry, but they exhibit inconsistent performance in terms of concrete compressive strength as compared to traditional sources. Several aggregate treatments, including mechanical abrasion and surface coatings were explored in this research, but without any marked improvement in strength. Observations of fracture patterns and aggregate porosity in split tensile cylinders suggest that the presence of dispersed natural porous aggregate particles in concrete may play a role in the superior strength of concrete made with Amabel dolostone. Keywords: : surface texture, interfacial transition zone (ITZ), light weight aggregate (LWA) I. Introduction The relationship between aggregate surface texture and the compressive strength of concrete has long been a topic of interest in concrete research. Ka- plan (1959) reported a correlation between surface texture and strength; the rougher the aggregate surface, the higher the concrete strength. Subse- quent research comparing smooth river gravel to crushed river gravel, or where rough aggregates were artificially made smooth by the application of various adherent coatings, in some cases found that rough surface textures did correlate with higher strength (Nepper-Christensen and Nielsen 1969, Nallathambi et al. 1984, Giacco and Zerbino 1998), and in other cases found and in other cases found that surface texture did not have a significant in- fluence (Darwin and Slate 1970, Al-Rawi and Al- Murshidi 1978). The improvement of bond charac- teristics within the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) has long been a focal point of efforts to increase strength in concrete, and is generally achieved by more efficient particle packing near aggregate par- ticles through the addition of silica fume or poly- mer dispersions (Jae-Ho and Robertson 1998, Ben- tur and Alexander 2000). Other ITZ enhancement strategies include locally lowering the water to ce- mentitious ratio (w/cm) within the ITZ by mixing concrete using dried aggregate; in the case of imper- meable aggregates, Ping and Beaudoin (1992) found that the elimination of water layers at the aggregate surface improved strength. On the other hand, the even dispersal of water-saturated lightweight aggre- gates (LWA) has been shown to reduce the overall volume of the ITZ within concrete (Bentz and Sny- der 1999, Bentz 2009). Densification of the ITZ has also been achieved by two-stage mixing strate- gies where water is added incrementally (Tamimi 1994, Li et al. 2012). The use of aggregate coat- ings to promote the formation of dense hydration products along the ITZ is another popular research theme. Nano-scale alumina and silica coatings, as well as calcined limestone, pozzolanic, and port- land cement based coatings have all been tried with varying degrees of success (Muñoz et al. 2010, San- filippo et al. 2010, Yang et al. 1992, Popovics 1987, Li et al. 2009, Zhihui et al. 2013). The premise that coarse aggregate surface texture is related to compressive strength was explored in this research for two different carbonate aggregate sources avail- able in southern Ontario: the Amabel dolostone, a durable rock that caps the weather-resistant Nia- gara Escarpment for over 400 km between Hamilton and Manitoulin Island, and the Gull River lime- stone, a stratigraphically older rock that outcrops east of the escarpment (Figure 1). Certainly, many other aggregate parameters can influence concrete strength, but this research was limited to an inves- tigation into alterations of the aggregate surface texture by abrasion or by the application of spe- cial coatings. In this research, a simple qualitative distinction was made between the macroscopically 97 Dehghan et al. Figure 1: Map of a portion of southern Ontario with quarry locations (Ontario Geologic Survey 2011). smooth surfaces of coarse aggregate produced from Gull River limestone, and the rough surfaces of the Amabel dolostone (Figure 2). No effort was made to directly quantify the surface texture of the aggregates either before or after the surface treat- ments, but the quantification of aggregate surface texture is a common research theme, especially in the fields of asphalt concrete and pavement friction (Wang et al. 2013, Luce et al 2007). Quantitative treatments of surface texture are less common in concrete strength research, although there has been considerable effort recently in the field of fresh con- crete rheology (Erdoğan et al. 2008). The geographic distribution and availability of high quality coarse aggregates for concrete do not always coincide with areas of high demand. For example, in Ontario, the rapidly growing Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is blessed with close proximity to sources of high quality Amabel dolostone, but the existing quarries are approaching exhaustion. At the same time, there is great public resistance to the opening of new quarries, or to the expan- sion of existing quarries in the Niagara Escarpment (D’Alesio and Howlett 2012, The Hamilton Spec- tator 2012, Dundas 2013, Van Dongen 2014). The prospects for new sources of Amabel dolostone are not promising, so the construction industry is ex- ploring alternative aggregate sources. The GTA is not alone in this respect. Aggregate shortages are projected in many North American regions, as sum- marized in recent geological survey reports (Langer 2011, Clinkenbeard 2012). For the GTA, the Gull River limestone represents a potential replacement for Amabel dolostone, but preliminary mixtures indicate that concrete pro- duced with Gull River limestone does not con- 98 sistently achieve the same compressive strengths as control concrete produced with Amabel dolo- stone. For example, Figure 3a compares compres- sive strengths from a series of parallel laboratory trial concrete mixtures exploring various cement contents using Amabel dolostone and Gull River limestone (St Marys/CBM & Davroc Consulting Engineers, 2011). Of course, for a concrete producer, there are many strategies to increase strength, from changes in ag- gregate proportion or gradation, to the incorpora- tion of silica fume or water-reducing admixtures — to name a few, but many of these strategies have limitations. For example, blended cement contain- ing silica fume is not available at all ready mix concrete plants, and could raise the cost. Both silica fume and water reducers will decrease the amount of bleed water, and when used during hot or dry weather, may require special care when it comes to proper concrete curing. The motivation behind this investigation was to allow the concrete producer to potentially switch to a surface-treated aggregate while maintaining their same basic mixture designs. II. Experimental Combined vacuum/high-pressure epoxy impregnation fluorescent Two representative 355 kg/m 3 cement content concrete split tensile cylinders, one with Ama- bel dolostone aggregate, and another with Gull River limestone were retained from the same labo- ratory trials as shown in Figure 3b. A novel com- bined vacuum/high-pressure process (Laugesen, 2012) was used to impregnate the cracks with a fluorescent-dyed (0.8 wt.% solvent yellow 43) low- viscosity (manufacturer listed 100 – 200 cP @ 100 rpm 23 C) epoxy to allow the qualitative obser- vation of fracture patterns. The impregnation was performed as follows: 1. Each cylinder was wrapped circumferentially with acrylic packing tape in a few locations to hold the halves together. Sharp corners were also covered with tape. 2. Each cylinder was slid carefully into a ⇠ 0.5m long segment of 0.1 mm wall-thickness low density polyethylene (LDPE) 115mm dia. tube with a simple overhand knot securely tied at the bottom (Figure 4a). Tape was also wrapped around the exterior of the bagged cylinder to prevent bulging during subsequent filling with epoxy. Excess tube length was folded back, leaving the top open for easy access to the cylinder. 3. Each bagged cylinder was individually placed in the vacuum chamber (Figure 4b).

The tubing was pinched closed at a location between the reservoir and the chamber, and the chamber evacuated by a rotary vane vacuum pump. The chamber was maintained at a pressure of 10 KPa for a period of 2 h. 4. ⇠ 350 ml of freshly mixed fluid epoxy was in- troduced from the filled reservoir into the open end of the bagged cylinder by releasing the clamped segment of tubing. Atmospheric pres- sure pushed the epoxy from the reservoir into the vacuum chamber, filling the bagged cylin- der. The clamp was closed before the epoxy level in the reservoir dropped below the tubing inlet. 5. After introducing the epoxy, the vacuum cham- ber was vented and the bagged cylinder re- moved. A sufficient volume of epoxy was in- troduced during the previous step to maintain a small head ( ⇠ 1 cm) of epoxy above the top of the cylinder after venting (a small drop in head typically occurs upon venting as epoxy is pushed into the cracks and pores of the con- crete). A second overhand knot was securely tied at the open end of the LDPE tube, making sure to first squeeze out excess air from the bagged cylinder. The excess tube was trimmed away and discarded, and a paper towel used to remove any remaining epoxy near the knot.

Figure 4: Steps in combined vacuum/high-pressure epoxy impregnation, knot in LDPE tube (a), vacuum chamber apparatus (b), pressure chamber apparatus (c). 6. The knotted and bagged cylinder was placed in a cold ap water filled pressure chamber, and hydrostatically pressurized to 25 MPa us- ing a pneumatic-driven liquid pump (Figure 4c). Cold water was used to help dissipate the heat generated during epoxy polymerization. The epoxy was allowed to cure in the pressure chamber overnight. Steps 4.-6. were performed within a 20 min pe- riod, so as to not exceed the pot-life of the fluid epoxy (after which the viscosity starts to increase). After curing, each cylinder was removed from the pressure chamber, cut into slabs with a water- cooled diamond saw, and polished smooth with a water-cooled hand held diamond pad polisher. The polished slabs were photographed both under normal room light conditions, and as illuminated with ultraviolet light. Materials The source of Amabel limestone used in this re- search originated from a quarry near Milton, On- tario (Figure 1). The Milton source consists of a light grey, porous, medium to coarsely crystalline dolomite with abundant fossils (Vos 1969). Two sources of Gull River limestone were used, one from a quarry near Orillia, Ontario, and another from a quarry near Buckhorn, Ontario (Figure 1). The Orillia source consists of a light grey to grey-brown, micritic to very fine-grained limestone (Armstrong and Anastas 1993). The Buckhorn source consists of a pale grey and brown sublithographic to litho- graphic limestone with occasional shaly seams (Car- son 1980). All of the coarse aggregates in this study had a maximum nominal size of 20 mm, and met CSA A23.1 Group 1 grading requirements. The physical properties of the aggregate sources are summarized in Table 1. III. Surface treatments Silicon carbide abrasion (SiC-abrasion) Abraded aggregates were produced in 10 kg batches by adding 3 kg of 1 mm (20 grit) SiC and 3 kg of water to a 100 L capacity concrete drum mixer and tumbled for 3 h. After tumbling, the aggregate was retained and rinsed over a 2 mm sieve. The SiC- abrasion process resulted in a mass loss of ⇠ 6 % Figure 5: Gull River limestone retained on the 4.75 mm sieve before abrasion (a), after SiC-abrasion (b), and after qtz-abrasion (c), magnified 2. 100 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 6: Gull River limestone gradation before and after SiC-abrasion (a), qtz-abrasion (b), paste-coating (c), and powder-coating (d).

Figs. 5a and 5b compare images of Buckhorn coarse aggregate particles as-received and after SiC-abrasion. Figure 6a compares the gra- dation of the Buckhorn coarse aggregate before and after SiC-abrasion. SiC-abrasion had little effect on the gradation, with minor loss of materials passing the 4.75 mm sieve. The edges of aggregate particles were rounded after SiC-abrasion, and the aggregate surfaces had a frosted appearance (Figure 5b). Natural quartz sand abrasion (qtz-abrasion) A quartz-rich natural sand from Wakefield, Québec was used to abrade aggregate in the same manner as the SiC-abrasion method. The sand originated from fluvially sorted glacial sediments generated by the Laurentide ice sheet, and met CSA A23.1 FA1 grading requirements. The qtz-abrasion process resulted in a mass loss of ⇠ 3.5 %. Figures 5a and 5c compare images of Buckhorn coarse aggregate particles as-received and after qtz-abrasion. Figure 6b compares the gradation of Buckhorn coarse ag- gregate before and after qtz-abrasion. Qtz-abrasion had little effect on the gradation, with minor loss of materials passing the 4.75 mm sieve. As with the SiC-abrasion treatment, the edges of aggregate particles were rounded, and the aggregate surfaces had a frosted appearance (Figure 5c). Table 1: Physical properties of aggregate.

Colloidal silica coating (nano-coating) For both the mortar and concrete experiments, rinsed and dried aggregates were dipped in a col- loidal silica suspension prepared from tetraethyl orthosilicate in dilute nitric acid, and then dried under ambient room conditions as outlined by Chu et al. (1997) and as refined by Muñoz et al. (2010) and Sanfilippo et al. (2010). Figure 7 shows a scan- ning electron microscope back-scattered electron (SEM-BSE) image of an Orillia coarse aggregate sur- face both before and after nano-coating. A sieve analysis was not performed after nano-coating, as the thickness of the coating would not affect the gradation in a detectable manner. Portland cement paste coating (paste-coating) Paste-coating was conducted in 10 kg batches by mixing 1 kg of GUL cement and 1 kg of water in a 100 L capacity concrete drum mixer for 30 s, followed by the gradual addition of the aggregate over a 1 min period. After an additional minute of mixing, the mixer was stopped, and allowed to rest for 3 min, followed by another 2 min of mixing. Next, the mixture was emptied over a 2 mm sieve, allowing excess paste to pass through. The aggregates then were dispersed in a one-particle thick layer on a sheet of polyethylene and cured under ambient room conditions for 5 d before use in the concrete mixtures. Figure 6c compares the gradation of the Buckhorn coarse aggregate before and after paste-coating. Paste-coating had little effect on the gradation. Portland coating) cement powder coating (powder- The powder-coating procedure was adopted from the common practice of coating aggregate with hy- drated lime for use in asphalt concrete (Bayomy 1992, Little et al. 2006). The aggregates were first soaked in water for 24 h, drained, and then dis- tributed in a one-particle thick layer over a sheet of polyethylene and air-dried until achieving a slightly higher than SSD condition with a moisture content of sim 4 %. Next, the aggregates in 10 kg batches were placed in the drum mixer and mixed while gradually adding 0.5 kg of GUL cement until the Figure 12: 7 and 28 d compressive strengths for concrete made with untreated Milton Amabel dolostone control, and made with untreated, SiC-abraded, qtz-abraded, nano-coated, paste-coated, and powder-coated Buckhorn Gull River limestone. 104 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands aggregates were coated and the excess moisture completely absorbed by the cement. The coated aggregates were cured under ambient room condi- tions for 5 d before use in the concrete mixtures. Figure 6d compares the gradation of the Buckhorn limestone coarse aggregate before and after powder- coating. Powder-coating had little effect on the gradation. Mortar mixtures In addition to the concrete experiments, parallel mortar experiments were conducted. For all mix- tures the cement content was fixed at 617 kg/m 3 , with a w/cm of 0.46. Oven dried aggregates were used in all mixes. SiC-abrasion and nano-coating treatments were performed on all three aggregate sources. In all the mortar mixtures, the crushed coarse aggregate consisted of 40 % of the total ag- gregate mass, and the fine aggregate was ASTM C-778 graded sand from Ottawa, Illinois. Concrete mixtures For the concrete mixtures, all five surface treat- ments were applied to the Buckhorn aggregate, with the untreated Milton aggregate as a control. For all mixtures the cement content was fixed at 362.5 kg/m 3 , with a w/cm of 0.45. The fine ag- gregate for all mixtures originated from the same source as used in the qtz-abrasion treatments, with a bulk specific gravity of 2.58 and an absorption of 0.55 %. For all the concrete mixture designs, the total aggregate volume was kept constant. The same cement was used as in the mortar mixtures, along with an air-entraining admixture at a con- stant dosage of 50 ml/100 kg cement. The target air content was 6 %. The fresh concrete properties are summarized in Table 2. Moisture contents of the untreated and abraded aggregate stockpiles were monitored and the material pre-weighed according to the mixture design. The aggregates were then soaked overnight in water. On the mix day, the soaked aggregates were drained and re-weighed to determine excess water assuming complete satura- tion, and then used for mixing. The nano-coated, paste-coated, and powder-coated aggregates were not soaked overnight, but used directly in the con- crete mixtures. The moisture contents were 0.55 %, 2.69 %, and 0.40 % respectively. The fine aggregate moisture stockpile moisture content was monitored, fell within a range of 3.50 – 3.80 %, and was used directly in the concrete mixtures. A 60 L capacity pan mixer was used to mix the concrete. IV. Results Fracture patterns of split-tensile samples Figures 8 and 9 compare macro-fracture patterns from split-tensile tested cylinders made with Am- abel dolostone to cylinders made with Gull River limestone. In the Gull River limestone concrete, well-defined fractures frequently deviate from the primary crack, and follow along the boundaries of coarse aggregate particles. Branching from the pri- mary crack is observed to a lesser extent in the Ama- bel dolostone concrete. High-porosity coarse aggre- gate particles are present in the Amabel dolostone concrete, but absent from the Gull River limestone concrete. Figure 10 compares typical micro-fracture patterns within the coarse aggregate particles split by the primary tensile crack. Mortar strength In the mortar trials all three aggregate sources ex- perienced avg. strength increases of ⇠ 15% with nano-coated aggregate, and avg. strength increases of ⇠ 12% with SiC-abraded aggregate as compared to the untreated aggregate (Figure 11). The nano- coating and SiC-abrasion treatments also brought the strength of the Gull River limestone mortars to similar levels as the untreated control Amabel dolostone mortar at both 7 and 28 d. Concrete strength The Gull River limestone surface treatments did not provide any improvement in compressive strength for the concrete mixtures (Figure 12). In most cases, with the exception of the powder-coating, the com- pressive strengths were even lower than that of the original untreated Gull River limestone concrete. V. Discussion The surface treatments tried here enhanced com- pressive strength in the mortar experiments, but did not enhance compressive strength in the con- crete experiments. One possible explanation for the disparity could be a difference in the available aggregate surface area between the mortar and the concrete. If the treatments did improve the ITZ, the available aggregate surface area might posi- tively correlate with strength. Assuming spherical mono-sized aggregates with a dia. of 3.56 mm (the mid-point between the 4.75 and 2.36 mm sieves) the air-entrained mortars would have a coarse ag- gregate surface area of about 300 m 2 per m 3 of mortar. The same calculation for concrete based on the sieve mid-points from the gradations shown in Figure 6 yields a coarse aggregate surface area of about 1100 m 2 per m 3 . From these estimates, the 105 Dehghan et al. Table 2: Fresh concrete properties.

One important difference between the mortar and concrete experiments for the abra- sion treated aggregate was the moisture condition: for the mortars the aggregate was mixed dry, and for the concrete the aggregate was pre-saturated and coated with surface water. Ping and Beaudoin (1992) reported that the presence of surface wa- ter layers on impermeable aggregates can degrade strength. Gull River limestone is not completely im- permeable, but it does have a very low absorption as compared to the Amabel dolostone (Table 1). An- other possibility is the rounding of particles from the abrasion treatments (Figure 5) led to a reduction in strength as compared to the more angular un- treated particles (Kaplan 1959). An explanation for the low strength of the nano-coated, paste-coated, and powder-coated treatments might be found in the more aggressive mixing environment of the pan mixer as opposed to the mortar mixer. Mixing en- ergy was not quantified in this research. However, based on the relatively smooth flow of the mortar between the bowl and the paddle, and the noisy scraping of the concrete between the pan and mixer blades, it is not unreasonable to speculate that the applied coatings may have been compromised in some way for the concrete mixes. But, if this were the case, it does not explain why the concrete with coated aggregates would be weaker than concrete with untreated aggregate. Although a satisfactory explanation for the con- trast in performance between the mortar and con- crete experiments has not been identified, the flu- orescent epoxy impregnated split tensile cylinders do provide an additional clue as to the superior performance of the Amabel dolostone. In Figure 8, porous aggregates are dispersed throughout the Amabel dolostone concrete, but not in the Gull River limestone concrete (Figure 9). The presence of these naturally porous aggregate particles is per- haps analogous to concrete containing saturated LWA. Concrete with LWA has generally demon- strated increased strength relative to concrete with 106 traditional coarse aggregates (Kayali 2008). The improved performance is attributed to enhanced internal curing, thereby eliminating or reducing the ITZ porosity, as well as the penetration of hydration products into the highly textured LWA surface (Er- dem et al. 2012). Another interesting observation involved frequent branching of the primary tensile crack in coarse aggregate particles from the Gull River limestone. Branching of the primary tensile crack in coarse aggregate particles from the Amabel dolostone was seldom observed (Figure 10). VI. Conclusion Experiments to alter the surface characteristics of Gull River limestone aggregate to enhance compres- sive strength showed promise in mortar. Compres- sive strengths for surface-treated Gull River lime- stone mortars were equivalent to untreated Amabel dolostone mortars. However, when the experiments were scaled up to concrete the surface-treatments failed to perform. A comparison of sectioned and polished slabs prepared from split tensile cylinders from Amabel dolostone and Gull River limestone concrete showed a higher frequency of cracking along the aggregate boundaries of Gull River aggre- gate particles, as well a higher frequency of within- aggregate branching of the primary tensile crack. In addition, porous aggregate particles were dis- persed throughout the Amabel dolostone concrete, and were not present in the Gull River limestone concrete. These naturally porous Amabel dolostone particles perhaps perform the same role as LWA particles in the improvement of the ITZ, and con- tribute to the superior compressive strength perfor- mance of concrete made with Amabel dolostone. The exploration of concrete strength enhancement strategies involving the blending of Gull River lime- stone aggregate with LWA is recommended.

Results from both sets of analysis show the presence of distinct phases associated with aragonite, brucite and cement paste. Phases associated with porosity and aggregates were also distinguishable through the BSE analysis and less defined in the nano-scratch data. This study indicates the powerful nature of coupling BSE image analysis with nano-scratching to obtain information on the quality of concrete. Work is underway to improve the method in order to apply it for better understand on the micro-physicochemical properties of marine exposed concrete. Keywords: marine environment, concrete, ESEM-BSE, nano-scratches, micro-physicochemical. I. Introduction Concrete quality must derive from its micro- chemical and-physical properties. Concrete may un- dergo degradation and healing processes which can affect its quality and subsequent durability. Evalua- tion and interpretation of the relationship between micro-chemical and -mechanical analysis should then provide key insights for better assessment of concrete durability. Since its use in the early1980s (Scrivener and Pratt, 1983), electron microscopy in backscattered electron (BSE) mode has shown great potential for assessing cementitious materials. BSE analysis produces a grey level image whose grey level values are based on the mean atomic num- ber of the target providing chemical information on the sample being analyzed. Scrivener and Pratt (Scrivener and Pratt, 1983; Scrivener et al. 1986; Scrivener, 2004) in their pioneering work revealed local variations in the microstructure of cementi- tious materials allowing the identification and quan- tification of distinct phases. A major draw back of the technique is, however, its inability to access ma- terials mechanical properties. Recent advances in nanoindentation have allowed greater understand- ing of nano- and micro-mechanical material prop- erties (Sanchez and Sobolev, 2010). Specimens pre- pared for nanoindentation must be smooth and flat making them ideally suited for BSE analysis. Re- cent combination of nanoindentation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in BSE mode has pro- vided new insights into the micro-physicochemical properties of cementitious materials (Chen et al., 2010). Nanoindentation by virtue analyses me- chanical properties at a point meaning that a large number of indents are necessary when analysing heterogeneous materials. An adaptation of nanoin- dentation is the nano-scratch technique whereby the indenter is scratched across a sample surface providing information on its scratch hardness. The continuous nature of the nano-scratch technique provides far greater information over time, and also property gradients and discontinuities across interphases, than its nanoindentation counterpart. This work is part of a larger study looking at the development of autonomous self-healing concrete for application in the marine environment. To the authors knowledge this is the first paper to combine BSE image analysis with nano-scratching for micro- physicochemical material analysis of cementitious 109 Palin et al.

II. Experimental approach Specimen preparation Mortar cubes were cast from OPC (CEM I 42.5 N, ENCI, the Netherlands) in accordance with EN 1015-11 (EN, 1999). The applied mortar mix de- sign is shown in Table 1. 24 hours after casting the mortar specimens were carefully removed from their moulds, tightly sealed in polyethylene plas- tic bags and kept at room temperature for a total curing period of 28 days. Autogenous healing incubation conditions Plastic buckets were prepared containing 4 l of synthetic sea-water (20 ± 2 C). The synthetic sea- water, to be called sea-water for the remainder of the text, was produced from technical grade chemi- cals (Sigma-Aldrich), the composition of which is shown in Table 2. Three cubes were submerged in each bucket. Water was changed every two weeks to mimic in situ conditions and prevent ion deple- tion. The buckets were kept open to the atmosphere during the experiment to allow for gas diffusion across the water-air interface.

In order to make the thickness of the specimens comparable and level, a thin section machine was used for cutting and grinding the specimens. After grinding, each sample was polished on a lapping table with 6 µm (1 hour), 3 µm (1 hour), 1 µm (1 hour) and 0.25 µm (4 hours) diamond spray (DP-Spray P, Struers, Copenhagen, Denmark). In between each spray the samples were submerged in ethanol and ultrasoni- cated (5 min) to remove debris. Following polishing samples were kept in a desiccator until testing. Scratch locations were identified before scratch- ing and digital images made using ESEM (Philips XL 30 ESEM, Eindhoven, Netherlands) in backscat- tered electron (BSE) mode. The instrument was operated at 20 kV accelerating voltage and at a working distance of 10 mm between the final con- denser lens and the specimen. The spot size was 5.0 µm and the magnification of the images was 500 ⇥ . Agilent Nano Indenter G200 (Agilent Technolo- gies, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA) with a diamond Berkovich tip was then used to produce the nano- scratches. A quartz standard was indented before and after each test series to ensure accuracy. A series of scratches were made at a wear load of 1 mN and velocity of 25 µm.s 1 . These scratches were 25 µm apart, perpendicular to the specimen surface and ran for a length of 200 µm. BSE images were taken of the scratched specimens. Compari- son between the initial and subsequent BSE images could then be made. MATLAB R2013b (The Math- Works, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA) was used to isolate the scratch line pixels in the unscratched images. Figure 1 (C and D) shows two scratch lines plotted in the form of two histograms. Each plot is the average grey level values of 6 pixels approxi- mating the scratch width. III. Results and discussion Figure 1 (A) and (B) show BSE micrographs of selected areas of the mortar specimen after submer- sion in sea-water. Detailed considerations on the effects of submerging concrete in sea-water have been given elsewhere (Palin et al., 2015, Glasser et al., 2008; Conjeaud, 1980). Based on this work it is known that concrete tends to leach ions increasing permeability, making the concrete susceptible to further attack including erosion due to wave action. Reaction of these ions with sea-water constituents can also form an aragonite-brucite mineral layer on its surface, which may reduce permeability, con- tributing specific properties to concrete. Evidence 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 1: (A) and (B) BSE micrographs of the scratch locations; (C) and (D) the histograms grey level distributions along the scratch lines; and (E) and (F) their corresponding scratch depth profiles. of these phenomena can be seen in the micrograph with the light grey area on the left hand side rep- resenting aragonite and the darker grey to its right representing brucite. This double layer is formed on top of the mortar, which can be seen as the area on the right hand side of the micrograph. Running horizontally through the micrograph are two white lines, which graphically represent the scratch paths. The histograms below the micrographs (Figure 1 (C and D)) represent the grey scale levels along the scratch lines. Due to compositional and hence grey level variations along the lines various phases can be distinguished. The relatively flat sections towards the left of the histograms represent the ho- mogenous phases of aragonite and brucite. As we move towards the right hand side of the two his- tograms more variance can be seen in the grey level values representing variance in the mortars chemi- cal composition, darker levels representing porosity and lighter levels anhydrous phases (Zhang et al., 2011). Figure 1 (E) and (F) show two nano-scratch profiles. Scratch depth variations are based on the micromechanical properties of the phases. We can see from the nano-scratch test that both aragonite and brucite have similar scratch profiles, indicat- ing similar hardnesses in line with the literature (Santhanam, 2013). This is interesting as the two phases have quite different grey scale values and hence chemical properties. However like the BSE histograms, the relative flatness of the scratch pro- files represents the homogeneity of the two min- eral phases. Once the nano-indenter leaves the aragonite-brucite double layer and begins scratch- ing the mortar, the scratch profile becomes more varied representing the heterogenic nature of the material. Shallower depths represent harder materi- als such as aggregates and deeper depths porosity. Nano-scratch analysis provides information on the nano- and miro-mechanical properties of cementi- tious materials such as their scratch and mar resis- tance. Interesting properties when trying to better assess the performance of cementitious materials, particularly those in the marine environment. The objective this research was to see if BSE mi- crographs could be coupled with nano-scratching to assess the micro-physicochemical properties of concrete exposed to the marine environment. Dis- tinct phases can be seen in both sets of analysis. Both techniques showed aragonite and brucite to have relatively flat profiles representative of their homogeneity, while the mortar profiles having more variance representative of its heterogeneity. We also saw correlation between some of the peaks and dips of the two techniques within the mortar rep- 111 Palin et al. resenting aggregates and pores. Although good correlation can be seen between the two methods, differences do remain. These differences may be based on fundamental differences between the two techniques, but may also be explained by differ- ences in the micro interaction volumes of the two techniques. Any difference in the interaction vol- umes would mean that the mechanical information provided by the nano-indenter and the chemical information provided by ESEM-BSE would not be directly comparable (Chen et al., 2010). Further investigation is required to assess whether the in- teraction volumes of the two techniques are closely comparable in location and size. IV. Conclusion BSE imaging and nano-scratching techniques have been combined for micro-physicochemical infor- mation on cementitious materials. Data generated from the two techniques correlated well, with both able to distinguish between phases associated with aragonite, brucite and cement paste. Though fun- damentally different, improved correlation between the techniques may be achieved by better matching the micro interaction volumes. Work is underway to assess and better match the interaction volumes of the two techniques. On a general level, this study illustrates the great potential in coupling BSE mi- croanalysis and nano-scratching for advancing our understanding on the relationships between the chemistry and mechanics of cementitious materials, particularly those in the marine environment. 112 V.

Veer Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands ⇤ olgavdvelde@gmail.com Abstract This paper shows the benefit of using transmitted light microscopy together with a Z-scanning software in frac- tographical analyses of glass. The strength of glass is largely dependent on processes that happen at the microscale. In this research, 52 plates were fractured in a biaxial tensile test. These were divided into five categories according to their fracture pattern. 6 plates were examined with a polarised light microscope and photographed with the Z-axis scanning function. This revealed fracture markings that are barely visible with the naked eye and overlooked when only performing a microscopic analysis of the fracture surface. This led to the conclusion that transmitted light microscopy on glass’ fracture pattern is a valuable addition in glass fractography. It gives the researcher an overview of all fracture markings and flaws in one image. This can be used as a guide to find the fracture origin and it gives new information on the crack propagation and local failure processes. Keywords: glass, microscopy, fractography I. Introduction In the last decades there has been an increase of the use of glass as a building construction material. Next to window panes, glass can also be used to build columns, walls and beams. However, a true glass revolution is impeded by its uncertainty in strength. Strength tests performed on glass can yield values as high as 150 MPa and as low as 20 MPa (Veer, 2007). Mostly the lowest value is assumed to be the strength of glass in structural design. This is a waste of material when the true strength of the glass is actually much higher. There- fore, more research in the strength of glass is desir- able. Glass researchers generally agree that these lower strengths are caused by flaws that weaken the glass (Bourhis, 2014, Quinn, 2007, Veer, 2007, Wurm, 2007). The types of flaws that occur in glass can be categorised by their location, see Figure 1. This paper follows this classification (Molnár et al. 2012): Figure 1: Flaws categorised by location (Molnár et al. 2012) In this research 52 plates were tested in a biaxial tensile test. Traditionally, the microscopy part of a fractographical analysis is only concerned with the fracture surface of the broken pieces. This paper explores the addition of observing the fracture pattern underneath the microscope. In other words, the angle of observation is turned 90 degrees. • Surface, such as scratches from mishandling or pits from weathering • Edge, such as grinding or polishing damage • Volume, such as air bubbles or inclusion formed in the glass during its manufacturig process. Glass fractography Quinn (Quinn, 2007) stated that the fractographical analysis of a specimen is just as important as the fracture stress found in the strength test. He argued that a fracture caused by one type of flaw cannot 113 van der Velde et al. Figure 4: Twist hackle (Quinn, 2007) Figure 2: Wallner lines (Shinkai, 1994) Figure 3: Regions marking the origin of fracture (Quinn, 2007) Figure 5: Ring on ring test values be statistically compared to one caused by another type. He promoted fractographical research to find the origin and fully understand the strength. Such an analysis of glass usually starts with a study of the fracture pattern. Either the specimens are taped to hold the fragments together or the shards are reassembled after failure. From the pattern, the origin crack can be determined by finding the crack that started branching first. The analysis finishes with collecting the fragments at that crack and examining the fracture surface. The flaw that caused the failure can be found by looking for certain marks. Wallner lines at this surface are oriented away from the fracture origin, see Figure 2. Following them back will lead to the flaw of origin (Shinkai, 1994). Around this flaw special marks can be found that prove it is the origin, see Figure 3 (Quinn, 2007). Lastly, twist hackle is sometimes reported, see Figure 4. Twist hackle shows the local direction of crack propagation. This is the ideal situation, but sometimes the fracture mechanism is more complex. Therefore, an additional procedure is suggested in this re- search: examining the fracture pattern underneath the microscope before collecting the fragments. The expectation is this will give more insight into the crack propagation and failure process. 114 II. Experimental The strength values of the glass in this research were determined by a Ring-on-Ring (RoR) test. It was chosen because the fracture stress is not in- fluenced by the flaw orientation and because it in- troduces a large area in the glass under constant bending stress. This stress can be calculated by the formula below (Morrel, 1998). Also see Figure 5. s b = 3P {( 1 2ph 2 n ) a 2 b 2 a + ( 1 + n ) ln } b 2R 2 (1) The dimensions used are a = 45 mm, b = 20 mm, R = 141 mm, h = 3.9 mm, n = 0.22. P is the load at failure. The dimensions are based on recommended ratios (Fessler and Fricker, 1984, Morrel, 1998). 52 soda lime silica glass plates were RoR tested in an Instron 8874 loading device. The specimen dimensions are shown in Figure 6. The cruciform shape was chosen to be able to introduce compressive stresses in a later stage of the total research. The specimens were taped with transparent foil, so that the fracture pattern could be studied after failure. Friction is known to be an issue in RoR tests. Various precautions were tried to minimise this. A full description and evaluation of them can be found in this research’s corresponding thesis (van der Velde, in preparation). 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 7: At high failure stress the pattern can include circumferential cracking at the loading ring (Quinn, 2007) Figure 6: Dimensions of the glass specimen After the RoR test, six of the fractured plates were examined by a Leica DM2500P petrographic microscope equipped with polarization accessories and semi-apochromat (fluorite) objectives. Optical photomicrographs of the glass specimens were acquired with a Leica DFC310FX digital camera at 1392 ⇥ 1040 uninterpolated resolution. In order to overcome the limited depth of field of the compound microscope, images were acquired through Leica LAS Live Z-Builder software which enabled dynamic emergence of the single in-focus image. The resulting image has a significantly large depth-of-field which renders the microstructural features of a glass specimen on a two dimensional final image. The advantage of this technique is that it makes all flaws and fracture markings that exist throughout the depth of the glass visible in a single field of view. Two light settings were used: • Transmitted light: polarised light enters the specimen from underneath illuminating all flaws inside the glass, • Reflected light: the specimen is lighted from above, mainly illuminating the surface. Unless mentioned otherwise, the transmitted light setting was used. All specimens were observed with their tensile side up. III. Results As is the case in most strength tests on glass, the results were quite variable, with strength values ranging from 42 MPa to 143 MPa. What was no- table is that there was a difference in fracture pat- tern among the results. Some plates had the ex- pected pattern: fracture origin inside the loading ring (category I) or at or just outside the loading ring (category R). Some of these were accompanied by a circumferential cracking pattern at the load- ing ring, as is reported in literature (?), see Figure 7. However some also showed such a pattern at the support ring, which is not mentioned in liter- ature (noted by an additional S). This might have two explanations: either the cracking pattern is cre- ated by a punching shear mechanism caused by friction between the glass and rings or the pattern is created by shock waves brought along by un- stable crack growth interacting with the branching cracks. Fractographical analysis might conclude this. Lastly, a few plates had a line-shaped frac- ture origin which is an indicator for a line-shaped flaw, such as a scratch on the surface (noted by an additional L). The plates that were examined with the microscope are depicted in the pictures on the next pages. The white circles mark the contact of the loading and support ring. The red arrows mark the likely origin crack. TT3, TT40 and TT10 were chosen because they had the smallest failure stress: 41.79 MPa, 56.16 MPa and 57.59 MPa, respectively. This is thought to be the case due to a line defect. Microscopical examination might prove this. The other three plates form a good representation of the fracture pattern categories. Fractographical analysis An analysis of each plate is made. TT3: At this magnification of the likely origin noth- ing much is seen. However looking at the left bot- tom, a lot of fracture marks are seen, see Figure 8c and 8d. Quinn states that the greater the failure stress at fracture, the more the stored energy and the richer the fracture marks (Quinn, 2007). There- fore it is concluded that on this line the actual origin point lies. Apparently the branching of the cracks was interpreted wrongly. In Figure 8e several origin like marks are observed. 115 van der Velde et al. a ) Fracture pattern, category IL b ) Likely origin point d ) magnification c ) magnification e ) magnification f ) magnification Figure 8: Fractographical analysis of TT3 a ) Fracture pattern, category IL b ) Likely origin point d ) magnification c ) magnification e ) magnification Figure 9: Fractographical analysis of TT10 116 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands a ) Fracture pattern, category IL b ) Likely origin point d ) magnification c ) magnification e ) magnification Figure 10: Fractographical analysis of TT40 a ) Fracture pattern, category I b ) Likely origin point d ) magnification c ) magnification e ) magnification Figure 11: Fractographical analysis of TT6 117 van der Velde et al. a ) Fracture pattern, category IS b ) Likely origin point d ) magnification e ) magnification c ) magnification f ) magnification Figure 12: Fractographical analysis of TT8 a ) Fracture pattern, category RS d ) magnification b ) Likely origin point e ) magnification Figure 13: Fractographical analysis of TT16 118 c ) magnification f ) magnification 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Which is the actual first one cannot be said from this image, but it does show multiple cracking processes followed up on one another. The last figure zooms in on one of them. TT10: This specimen gave quite a straightforward analysis. At the first crack a clear shell-shaped mark can be seen in Figure 9c. In Figure 9d stable crack growth is observed. Interestingly at the arrow a point where unstable crack growth commences is marked. Figure 9e zooms in at a magnification at the centre of shell shape where the cracking process started. Analysis of the fracture surface will have to conclude whether it is the actual point of origin. TT40: In Figure 10c, made with reflected light instead of transmitted light, the crack branching is clearly seen which suggests this is the origin crack. In transmitted light in Figure 10d no starting point can be marked, but it could be blocked from view by the shadows. Looking at Figure 10e in transmitted light something interesting is going on. Twist hackle marks are observed at the sides, both with their propagation direction (marked by arrows) towards the origin crack. This is special because mostly crack propagation runs away from the origin point. Whether this is a coincidence or the origin point is actually located somewhere else cannot be concluded from this analysis alone. TT6: The location of the fracture origin is clearly visible in this specimen. However, under the microscope so much light was coming through a gap at the crack of interest that the image was too bright. Therefore Figure 11c was taken in crossed polarised light. Despite giving a spectacular picture, in this light it is harder to distinguish the fracture marks, so it is less suitable to draw conclusions about the fracture pattern. On a sidenote, crossed polarised light can be useful in determining the composition of a material’s components. TT8: In this specimen the transmitted light was blocked at the crack of interest. Therefore Figure 12d was taken with reflected light only. Especially to the left, crack growth marks are observed. The origin of fracture might be found there. Figure 12e is taken to the right from the origin crack (the red dot can be used as a reference). Here twist hackle is captured that gives an indication of the ongoing crack propagation TT16: The origin crack seemed to have been found but under the microscope hardly any fracture marks were observed, nor in Figure 13d. Looking back at Figure 13c a lot more marks are observed to the left, which are shown in Figure 13e. Interestingly, stable crack growth is seen in the form of beach marks but they seem to be taken over by unstable crack growth in the form of hackle. At the centre of this hackle, next to the crack more stable crack growth marks were captured in Figure 13f. The fracture may have originated there instead. IV. Discussion Firstly it should be stressed that these are all 2D images of features that are located at different depths in the glass. While interpreting them this should be borne in mind to make sure the right conclusions are drawn. This can be aided by making photographs of just the glass surface before building the 3D images, so that it can be checked whether a certain feature is at the surface or inside the glass. It is the opinion of the authors that this technique works best in combination with fracture surface analysis, but definitely is a valuable addition. For TT3 and TT16 it seems the wrong origin crack was concluded from the visual fracture pattern analysis. In a fracture surface analysis this would have been discovered by following the Wallner lines at the fracture surface to the right origin point. However, by looking at the fracture pattern by transmitted light microscopy this can be seen in one glance and immediately gives a direction at which point to look in the fracture surface analysis. Therefore it is recommended to use these Z-axis scanned images as an overview to contemplate during the fracture surface analysis. For example for TT10 a very clear spot is marked where the fracture origin can probably be found. When having found the fracture origin at the fracture surface the researcher then can use the Z-axis scanned image to gain an understanding of the rest of the cracking process. This process cannot be deduced in one view by examining only the fracture surface. And interpreting the fracture pattern by eye can lead to wrong assumptions. This is nicely seen in the case of TT8 where twist hackle marks the crack prop- agation at several location in the glass in one image. The authors recognise that this technique on its own does not give the final conclusion or even the desired images as was the case for TT40 and TT6. It turns out it depends on the position of the shards in the glass whether enough or too much light is let through and a good image can be made. Although it might be possible to improve this by exploring all settings of the polarised microscope. These results represent a first try out of this tech- nique. Further research of more plates including fracture surface analysis and significant strength data is expected to show the value of transmitted light microscopy even better. 119 van der Velde et al. V. Conclusion A transmitted light microscopy analysis combined with Z-axis scanning software gives the glass researcher an overview of all fracture markings throughout the depth of the glass plate in one image. In combination with the fracture surface analysis this image can be used as a map which guides the researcher in their search of the fracture origin. More importantly, it reveals fracture markings that give new insights into the crack propagation and the local failure process that are overlooked in traditional glass fractography. Based on the findings of this study, it can be con- cluded that transmitted light microscopy, together with Z-axis scanning software is a valuable tool for glass fractography and its use needs to be further explored. 120 Acknowledgements Many thanks to Rob Nijsse for his contribution on the overall research, to Ger Nagtegaal and Kees van Beek for their assistance on the strength tests and to Kees Baardolf for his technical contributions.

In recent years nano-indentation is being applied on different levels to obtain local mechanical properties. The aim of this paper is to explore various ways to obtain these properties by combining nano-indentation and microscopy. The method to prepare specimens and perform the testing is explained and the way the properties are used in the modelling is discussed. Keywords: nano-indentation, hardness, stiffness, lattice model, multi-scale modelling I. Introduction Multi-scale modelling is a popular technique to get insight into mechanical properties and to explain damage and deterioration mechanisms in cement based materials. With a model on a certain scale the (non-linear) properties of a material on that scale can be predicted. These properties can subse- quently be used as input parameters for the local properties on a next scale as sketched in Figure 1. Here the microstructure of a cement paste is sim- ulated using the HYMOSTRUC 3D model (Figure 1a) according to Ye (2003). This microstructure can then be used to study the mechanical properties of a cement-paste cube at a certain degree of hydra- tion (Qian et al. 2011). For the simulation of the fracture behaviour various types of models can be used, such as discrete element type or lattice type models (Schlangen, 1993). The outcome of such a simulation on the scale of cement paste is a non- linear stress-strain relation which can be used as input for the simulation of mechanical properties of mortar as depicted in Figure 1b. The outcome of a simulation on the mortar scale is again the input for the concrete scale in which the aggregate particles in the material, see Figure 1c, should be modelled (Qian, 2012). To be able to perform simulations of a heteroge- neous material on a certain scale the local proper- ties of the components of the material have to be known. For instance, for simulating the mechanical behaviour of the cement-paste shown in Figure 1a, the mechanical properties of the single phases (un- hydrated cement and different hydration products) are required. For the simulation of the concrete in Figure 1c the properties of the aggregates and the mortar are needed as well as the interface between them. These local properties are not easily mea- sured. Various attempts can be found in literature to obtain them from direct tests on for instance an aggregate attached to a cement paste (Ağar-Özbek et al, 2013) or trying to simulate them with a lower scale model (Bentz et al. 1995). Furthermore it should be noted that these local material properties, such as strength and Young’s modulus, are most probably not single values, but the local behaviour is actually a non-linear stress strain relation. At the atomic scale the local mechanical behaviour might be brittle, but at all higher scales some non-linearity has to be implemented in the multi-scale modelling concept. This non-linearity is different at each scale, which makes it rather complex. The general pro- cedure to simulate mechanical response is to start with a brittle behaviour for fracture at the lowest scale of observation (see e.g. Qian, 2012) and then use non-linear behaviour at all higher scales to keep the error as small as possible. Another way to obtain local mechanical prop- erties that can be used as input for simulations is nano-indentation. This method is initially de- veloped for homogeneous materials and especially thin films to obtain local mechanical properties such as hardness and stiffness. However it is also used to get local mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials by indenting in the different phases of the material. First applications for cement-based mate- 121 in figure 1b.. The outcome of a simulation on the mortar scale is again the input for the concrete scale in which the aggregate particles in the material, see figure 1c, Luković et al. should be modelled (Qian, 2012). Figure 1: a) Generated cement-paste microstructure, b) multi-scale modelling scheme and c) generated concrete sample with irregular aggregates. rials can be found in Constantinides and Ulm (2004) or Hughes and Trtik (2004). Using these proper- ties as input for modelling mechanical properties of cement paste material is shown in Bernard et al. (2003) and it is applied for simulating degradation mechanisms by Çopuroğlu and Schlangen (2008). Rev. 11/2014 The difficulty with nano-indentation in hetero- geneous materials is that it is impossible to indent in a single phase and the materials are generally 3D, which means the material below the indent might be of a different phase. The results obtained from the indentation will therefore always be a com- bined property of various phases. Furthermore the properties from nano-indentation cannot be directly implemented into a model. Local properties of an element in a model might be dependent on the scale of the element or other parameters that are specific for the model that is used. The aim of the study presented in this paper to give more insight in the use of different nano- indentation techniques for cement-based materials at different scales and the way the outcome from the nano-indentation measurements can be used in models. In this paper three different ways of applying nano-indentation to obtain mechanical properties are discussed. All methods are supported by nu- merical simulations with a lattice model. The first method is used to obtain local properties in a re- pair system of repair material (cement paste) on a mortar. Main focus is on the properties of the zone around the interface and whether the local mechan- ical properties can be linked to the failure of the in- terface. The second method is a 3D nano-indention on cement paste samples to study the effect of the sub-surface microstructure on the measured prop- erties. Finally the use of nano-indentation to obtain more global properties of cement paste is presented. II. Experimental procedure and results Specimen preparation The specimens used in the three methods of nano- indentations are all prepared in the same way. The specimens were prepared for a study on the perfor- mance of repair systems (Luković, in preparation). The substrate was 5 year old mortar casted with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) CEM I 42,5 N.

This is done by combining the experimental results with numerical simula- tions. Measured local micromechanical properties are used as input for numerical modelling with the Rev. 11/2014 lattice model which enables estimation of the global micromechanical response (properties) of the tested microstructure. An example of this is shown in Figure 3b, where a 2D sample is loaded in tension (vertically). The local properties implemented in the model correspond with the local hardness and stiffness as measured in a sample shown in Figure 3a. The final crack pattern that is the outcome of 124 for the surface of a material. For heterogeneous materials this always results in an error since the phase of the material below the surface might (and will) be different in most cases. The effect of eval- uating 2D instead of 3D quantities is examined by a combination of experimental and numerical research (Luković et al., 2015). In this study, nano- indentation testing was applied on successive slices in cement paste. The same specimens and prepara- tion method as explained above were used. First, one slice was prepared, tested in nano-indentation and checked in ESEM (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope). Then, the top layer (around 16 µm) is removed, the sample polished, and the same area tested again. A procedure, ensuring that the same area is tested in every consecutive slice, is developed.

Discussion and Conclusions In this paper a combination of experimental tech- niques using nano-indentation and a modelling technique using 3D discrete lattice model simula- tions is applied to study the failure mechanism in cement paste specimens at micro-scale. As input for the simulations, mechanical proper- ties for the local lattice elements are needed. These can be obtained from local nano-indentation mea- surements in single phases of the heterogeneous composite. However, these properties cannot be used directly, because they depend on the size of the elements used in the model and should be transferred to model-parameters. Furthermore it should be noted that the results obtained from nano- indentation on the surface of a heterogeneous ce- ment paste always includes an error, because the result is influenced by the phase below the surface. In this paper different techniques and applica- tions of nano-indentation are presented and dis- cussed. First 2D nano-indentation is used to deter- mine local properties around an interface between mortar and repair material. This method is valu- able when studying for instance the influence of microstructure formation in a repair system and the resulting local mechanical properties on the per- formance and crack formation in such a system. A 3D nano-indentation method is shown which is useful to evaluate the influence and scatter of using 2D-data for studying 3D mechanisms. Fi- nally a method is presented for making small scale cement-paste specimens and fail them with nano- indentation. This method is useful to validate ex- perimentally simulation tools that are used in a multi-scale framework.

One of the most interesting examples of early concrete objects in Austria is the Parish church of Weissenbach an der Triesting near Vienna. The church was constructed between 1891 and 1893 using a novel double wall system: the inner wall was built from brick and the whole façade was covered with different prefabricated PC concrete elements. The present study introduces the material characteristics of some of the original concrete elements at the church. Thin and polished sections of the samples were analyzed in the optical and scanning electron microscope in order to determine the properties of the cement and aggregates. Façade elements, such as ledges, show a double-layered structure: a dense outer layer is followed by a porous tamped concrete layer to lighten the element. Composition and grains size of unhydrated clinker phases and the presence of solid fuel remnants suggest the use of a shaft kiln, inhomogeneous raw meal, firing conditions and slow cooling rates. Differences in the microporosity between the two layers refer to different w/c-ratios during the production of materials. SEM-EDX measurements and element ratio plots highlight the composition and change in the binder due to the interaction of cement hydrate phases, aggregates, and atmospheric pollutants. Additionally, dolomite aggregates exhibit the phenomenon of dedolomitization, manifesting in the transformation of CaMg ( CO 3 ) 2 grains into calcite and brucite. The phenomenon, however, is not connected with the formation of alkali-silica gel, thus it is harmless and cannot be classified as deleterious ACR. Keywords: Portland cement, historic concrete, clinker phases, optical microscopy I. Introduction Portland cement was first produced in 1856 as nat- ural cement in Austria. The last decades of the 19 th century, however, were dominated by the use of Roman cements as hydraulic binders (Zehetner, 2010). At the turn of the 20 th century this trend rapidly changed and the success story of Portland cement has begun in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Some of the most interesting applications of Port- land cement in Eastern Austria were connected to the talented Austrian engineer Adolf Freiherr von Pittel (1838-1900). In the 1870s he established sev- eral cement plants near Vienna, where hydraulic lime and Roman cement were produced, but he promptly completed his array of products with prefabricated casts and artificial stones made from Portland cement (Heimel et al, 2010). Pittel’s suc- cess resulted not only in the good quality hydraulic binders he produced, but also in the widely dis- tributed prefabricated products (Figure 1) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and some exclusively managed patents in the field of concrete technology (Heimel et al., 2010). One of Pittel’s main creations was the Parish church in Weissenbach an der Triesting (Lower Aus- tria, Figure 2), which he donated to his community. It was constructed between 1891 and 1893 using a double wall system: the inner wall was built from brick and the whole façade was covered with pre- fabricated PC concrete elements (Heimel et al, 2010). The present study is a part of an international coop- eration aimed at studying the 19 th century concrete buildings within the territory of the former Austro- Hungarian Empire. Due to the abundance of large unhydrated ce- ment grains and non-carbonated cement paste in the samples, the paper focuses on the chemical- mineralogical characterization of residual clinker phases and hydration products, attempting to deter- mine the original composition, characteristics, and production techniques of the cement and concrete. 131 ng m, Pintér & Gosselin II. Sampling and analytical methods Two samples, one from a slightly damaged ledge (WB-1) at the western façade (Figure 2) and an- other concrete fragment from the socle (WB-2) on the southern side, were taken for analyses. Thin and plane sections prepared from the samples were etched with Nital (1.5 ml of HNO 3 in 100 ml of isopropyl alcohol; Campbell 1999) for 7 to 9 sec- onds and analyzed in the optical microscope (Zeiss AXIOScope A1) using reflected and transmitted po- larized light. Depending on the reactivity of the cement phases, alite normally turned blue to tan; be- lite was brown to blue and both phases showed de- tails of internal structure (Campbell, 1999). Phases of the interstitial matrix (C 3 A and ferrite) were light gray and white in color. Non-etched polished sec- tions were coated with carbon and analyzed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss EVO MA 15), coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spec- trometer (EDS, Oxford DryCool, 15kV, 300 pA). A number of standardized point analyses were used to characterize the chemical composition of the binders.

A significant portion of cement grains have re- mained unhydrated (Figures 6 to 11). Traces of hydration could mainly be observed on the mar- gins of the residual phases.

The presence of monocarbonate can be explained by the high amounts of fine grained carbonate (dolomite) filler, which has partly reacted during hydration with the aluminate phases. 136 There is a considerable amount of sulphate-bearing phases in both samples, which suggests the presence of primary Ca-sulphate in the cement. Historical data (Riepl, 2008) show that since 1889 the 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands test, on the non-carbonated zone of the matrix, has been expressed in atomic ratio plots Ca, Si, Al and S. Si/Ca vs. Al/Ca plots (Figures 16a and 17a) of both samples show the presence of different fine grained AF t (ettringite) and AF m phases. Further- more, the Si/Ca ratio of the inner C-S-H indicates, especially in the sample WB-2 (Figure 17b; yellow ellipse), higher values than those of the theoretical Si/Ca ratio (0.58) given as a reference for pure syn- thesized C 1.7 SH. This difference may be explained either by partly decalcified C S H and/or by the influence of the clay fraction in the raw materials and subsequent clinker. The presence of portlandite confirms the alkaline environment in the binder. Values plotted in the Al/Ca vs. S/Ca plots (Fig- ures 16b and 17b) confirm the nature of AF m phases. In the sample WB-1 (Figure 16b) the main AF m phase is monosulphate, coexisting probably also with some minor amount of monocarbonate, as suggested by the dots marked by the red ellipse. In the sample WB-2 monosulphate is completely replaced by monocarboaluminate, as characterized by the values 0.15 to 0.4 (Al/Ca) and 0.02 to 0.05 (S/Ca). The presence of monocarbonate can be explained by the high amounts of fine grained car- bonate (dolomite) filler, which has partly reacted during hydration with the aluminate phases. There is a considerable amount of sulphate- bearing phases in both samples, which suggests the presence of primary Ca-sulphate in the cement. Historical data (Riepl, 2008) show that since 1889 the Association of Austrian Cement Plants allowed a maximum gypsum content of 2% in PCs, which can be interpreted as a deliberately admixed addi- tive. However, the use of a solid fuel containing natural SO 3 -bearing phases (Michaelis, 1869) and its effect on the clinker composition (e.g. larger amount of alkali-sulphates formed during firing) as well as on hydrate phases cannot be excluded. The effect of excess sulphate is suggested by the atomic ratio plots. External SO 3 has reacted with monosulphate to produce secondary ettringite, which could also be detected as secondary pore fillings or sometimes in the form of reactivated C 3 A around unhydrated residual cement. A crack pat- tern due to expansive forces cannot be seen. IV. Conclusions Using reflected and transmitted polarized light mi- croscopy, completed with SEM-EDS measurements on polished and thin sections, the composition and material characteristics of two historic, pre- fabricated PC concrete elements from the Parish church in Weissenbach an der Triesting, dating back to 1893, were carried out. The low to moderate w/c ratio and the use of historical grinding tech- niques have induced the preservation of several unhydrated residual cement grains in the samples. These residual grains contained all four main PC phases; their relative amount, crystal size and shape suggested, however, different burning and cooling conditions and raw feed composition in compar- ison with modern PC clinkers. Features such as inhomogeneous crystal sizes of alite exhibiting fre- quently decomposition into belite on its margin, fingerlike sections of belite and coarse crystalline flux phases suggest slow cooling rates and eventu- ally also reducing conditions during the calcination process. Due to the coexistence of the different be- lite types, uneven kiln temperatures and cooling rates, typical for shaft kilns, can be assumed. Beside the aforementioned observations, for modern PC atypical clinker phases containing C 2 AS and prob- ably also other low temperature, non- or slightly hydraulic Ca-(aluminate)-silicates also suggest in- homogeneous heat distribution during firing. Small fragments of graphite-bearing inclusions indicate the use of a solid fuel. Crushed dolomite sand used as aggregate in both concrete elements exhibited partly dedolomitiza- tion on marginal zones and along cracks. The reac- tion, however, is not connected with the formation of ASR, thus it is harmless and cannot be defined as alkali-carbonate reaction. Binder portions with preserved alkalinity en- abled to determine the nature of hydration products based on the chemical composition of the cement paste. Although the formation of secondary et- tringite from monosulphate due to excess SO 4 2 rather suggests the use of Ca-sulphate as setting re- tarder admixed to the cement, the effect of sulphur- rich fuel producing alkali-sulphates in the clinker phases during firing cannot be excluded either. One of the samples clearly indicated the effect of the fine-grained carbonate aggregate portion on the hy- dration products: monosulphate was replaced by monocarboaluminate. In the other sample mono- sulphate coexisted with some minor amount of monocarbonate. Based on the extensive investigations of the sam- ples it can be concluded, that the cement used for producing the concrete elements was burned in a shaft kiln above the sintering temperature, but still under inhomogeneous heat distribution, with prob- ably long residence time, slow cooling rates and inhomogeneous raw feed. Chemical data of the ce- ment paste suggests the use of artificially admixed Ca-sulphate as a setting retarder. The factors such as the w/c-ratio, grading curve of the aggregates and the partial reaction of the sand particles with clinker phases during the hydra- tion have played an important role in a remarkable performance of the concrete cast elements during the last 120 years. 137 Pintér & Gosselin Figure 16a: Si/Ca vs. Al/Ca plot of the X-ray data (WB-1) Figure 16b: Al/Ca vs. S/Ca plot of the X-ray data (WB-1) Figure 16: a) Si/Ca vs. Al/Ca plot of the X-ray data (WB-1), b)Al/Ca vs. S/Ca plot of the X-ray data (WB-1).

Two kinds of stucco were detected: the first one contains dolomitic lime as binder and quartz and silicate crystals as aggregate; the second one contains calcium lime as binder and calcite crystals or limestone clasts as aggregate. The stucco composition and the presence of two different combinations in two stucco-works of the same room were compared with some excerpts of Vasari’s Lives of the Artists (1568) concerning Giulio Romano, Francesco Primaticco and Giovanni da Udine. Keywords: stucco, aggregate, Italian Mannerism, Mantua I. Introduction Stucco is a building material easily shaped and largely used for architectural decoration and sculp- ture (Davey, 1961). The employ started in Roman times for the bas-relief decoration on the walls and vaults (Robertson, 1964); the technique was brought back by Giovanni da Udine (early 16 th cen- tury)(Murray, 1967), then it was improved in the Baroque and Rococo decorations of Northern Italy (Wittkover, 1963), Austria and Bavaria (Hempel, 1965). The typical stucco is made of two superimposed coats: the lower one, or render coat, is made of lime and fluvial sand, the upper one, or finish coat, is made of lime and marble powder. As other ar- tificially made materials, the stucco features may change according to the location, to the craftsman or to the period of setting, particularly whit regard to the aggregate employed in the finish coat (Cav- allo et al., 2005; Rampazzi et al., 2012). An outstanding example of stucco-work of the Mannerist period is the decoration of Palazzo Te in Mantua, built and decorated on a plan made by Giulio Romano. The comparison between the analytical data and some excerpts of Vasari’s Lives of the Artists regarding the decoration of Palazzo Te, should be useful to discriminate the work of different craftsmen in this building. II. Mantua and Palazzo Te Mantua is a Lombard town lying in the lower Pada- nia plain near the river Po and it was the capital of the Gonzaga’s Duchy from 1328 to 1708. Palazzo Te was built outside Mantua by Giulio Romano in the years 1525/35 for the leisure of the Duke Federigo. Giulio Romano, born in Rome (1499), was a follower of Raphael and worked at the Gonzaga’s court from 1524 until his death (Mantua 1546). Palazzo Te has only a ground floor and mezzanine with a Doric order, all in brick with rough-cast facing (Figures 1- 2); Giorgio Vasari described it as a quadrangular building with an open courtyard in the centre (ex- cerpt A). As declared by Burckhardt: "Palazzo Te contains the most complete group surviving intact of many decorated rooms of differing size, height, architectural design and purpose, the decoration largely as an accompaniment to cycles of pictures; these presented in very varied forms and arrange- ments, in oil as well as fresco. Colour and decora- tive motives determined according to the scale and function of the room; alternation of painting and white or polychrome stucco" (Burckhardt, 1987). Three decorated rooms were chosen in order to analyse different kinds of stucco-works. 139 Bugini & Folli Figure 1: Palazzo Te, looking from south. III. Methods The scientific study is pointed out on the stucco fin- ish coat (2-3 mm thick) in order to identify the com- ponents. The study employed some microscopic methods as: optical microscopy on thin section cut normally to the surface; scanning electron mi- croscopy on polished section and X-ray diffraction on powders.

Discussion The main feature of the stucco finish coat set in some rooms of Palazzo Te, is the use of an aggre- gate mainly made of quartz: this kind of aggregate is present both in moulded and in modelled ar- tifacts. The use of quartz aggregate represents a noticeable divergence in comparison with the tra- ditional aggregate composition reported in ancient stucco recipes. This divergence is also present in comparison with several stucco finish coats set in various periods of Lombard architecture and ana- lyzed by microscopic methodologies (Bugini et al., 1998; Folli-Bugini, 2001; Pracchi-Bugini, 2001). Calcite aggregate The stucco composition, reported by Vasari (ex- cerpts B,C) and by many other Ancient Authors Figure 10: Thin section, cross polarized light. 142 Figure 12: Thin section, cross polarized light. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 13: Soldier of the upper frieze. Figure 15: Soldier of the lower frieze. ners, good sorting) are compatible with the features of river sand deposits pertaining to a basin contain- ing limestone outcrops: river basins on carbonate rocks are spreaded all around the Lombard Prealps. (Latin as Vitruvius and Plinius, Italian as Alberti and Milizia, French as D’Aviler and Rondelet) points out the presence of an aggregate made of crushed calcite called marble powder. In Palazzo Te, only two stucco-works of Camera degli Stucchi (one of the friezes and a statue) con- tain a calcium carbonate aggregate: calcite crystals or limestone clasts (Bugini-Folli, 2011). In the first case, calcite crystals are of two sorts: bladed monocrystalline grains (maximum size 0.6 mm) with sharp corners at oblique angles (75 ) according to the rhombohedral cleavage and with- out twinning; equant subrounded polycrystalline grains (maximum size 1.0 mm) with polysintethic twinning. The origin of this kind of aggregate is a carbonate raw material (calcite marble, calcite vein) artificially crushed according to the the Vitruvius description of the marble for use in stucco: <In places where marble is not found , the broken bits of marble (...) which marble-workers throw down as they works, may be crushed and ground and used in stucco after being sifted> (Vitruvius). In the second case, limestone clasts features (size range 0.1-0.6 mm, equant shape, subrounded cor- The whole stucco-work of both Camera dei Venti and Camera delle Aquile and one of the friezes of Camera degli Stucchi were made using an aggre- gate mainly made of quartz (single crystals and polycrystalline grains) with a low percentage of clasts made of gneiss or limestone. Quartz clasts are of two sorts: opaque, rod-shaped angular poly- crystalline grains (maximum size 1.0 mm) with undulose extinction; transparent uneven angular single crystals (maximum size 0.6 mm) with unit extinction (Bugini-Folli 2011). On the basis of a microscopic comparison within grain morphology of different kind of sands, the quartz crystals of the stucco-work of Palazzo Te are similar to the quartz crystals (conchoidal fractures and irregular edges) produced by the fine crushing, using a hammer, of a quartz pebble, pebbles of this composition are diffused in loose deposits of the Figure 14: Thin section, cross polarized light. Figure 16: Thin section, cross polarized light. Quartz aggregate 143 Bugini & Folli alpine rivers of Lombardy. The use of quartz aggre- gate is neglected by Ancient Authors, but it is well documented in many plasters made by the Romans in Mediolanum-Milan (Bugini et al., 2013). The scant variation observed in the aggregate composition, normally occur in a artificially made material as stucco: in the case of Palazzo Te, a minor fraction of sand was probably added to the crushed quartz fraction. Binder composition The binder composition also seems to modify ac- cording to the change of aggregate composition: the use quartz aggregate is associated with the use of dolomitic lime; the use of calcite or limestone aggregate is associated with the use of calcium lime. Craftsmen The use of two kinds of aggregate (quartz-silicate or carbonate) in some rooms of Palazzo Te can be a proof of the work of two craftsmen using hetero- geneous working method. Moreover the presence of three aggregates in the stucco-work of the Cam- era degli Stucchi, carries several hypotheses: the work of two craftsmen to make different parts of the stucco decoration; the work of a craftsman using different kinds of aggregate to make stucco accord- ing to the typology (bas-relief, statue); a subsequent remaking of some parts of the decoration with a change of the raw material source. The presence of different craftsmen during the decoration of a building is well documented in Palazzo Te, according to Vasari: many craftsmen worked to decorate the rooms under the leadership of Giulio Romano (excerpt D). In particular, two artists are indicated concerning the decoration of Camera degli Stucchi: Francesco Primaticcio and Giovan Battista Mantovano (excerpt D). Primatic- cio (Bologna 1504 - Paris 1570) is one of the few artists, together with Titian and Sansovino, still liv- ing at the time of the print (1568) of Vasari’s book; G.B. Scultori called G.B. Mantovano (Mantua 1503 - 1575) is recorded as disciple of Giulio Romano and it is also mentioned in " Lives of Marc’Antonio Bolognese and other engravers of print" and in " Lives of Benvenuto Garofalo and Girolamo da Carpi painters". It is still difficult to attribute the stucco-work to each craftsman because of the ab- sence of comparative scientific analyses. The read- ing of Vasari’s biographies nevertheless introduces a lack of certainty: in a first quotation (excerpt D) the author ascribes the double frieze of Camera degli Stucchi to the work of Primaticcio and Man- tovano, in a second one (excerpt E) Vasari ascribes the same frieze to the sole work of Primaticcio. 144 VII. Conclusion The finish coat of Mannerist stucco-works of three rooms of Palazzo Te in Mantua shows different fea- tures: angular quartz crystals and silicate clasts as aggregate together with a dolomitic lime as binder (cornices and figures of Camera dei Venti and Cam- era delle Aquile, upper frieze of Camera degli Stuc- chi); calcite crystals as aggregate and calcium lime as binder (lower frieze fo Camera degli Stucchi); limestone clasts as aggregate and calcium lime (and also gypsum) as binder (Hercules statue of Camera degli stucchi). Raw materials come from outside and they are not available in the town surroundings: Mantua, lying in the center of the Northern Italian alluvial plain (Padania), is far from stone outcrops and from stone quarries. The use of quartz as aggregate, instead the cal- cite, is not reported by Ancient Authors, but it is documented in plaster finish coats of some Roman sites of Lombardy. The use of different aggregate in two similar stucco-works of the same room (Camera degli Stucchi) may be explained by the presence of two craftsmen working at the same time in the room. This detail is reported by Vasari’s Lives of the Artists in some excerpts related to the erection and the decoration of Palazzo Te in Mantua: in particular Vasari points out the names of F. Primaticcio and G.B. Mantovano. Excerpts from Giorgio Vasari’s Lives of the artists [ Devere 1912-15, Maclehose 1907 ] Excerpt A - Life of Giulio Romano painter [ vol. VI ] : <Giulio set his hand to the work [ Palazzo Te ] (...). And since the place [ Mantua ] has no living rock, and no quarries from which to excavate material for hewn and carved stones, (...) he made use of brick and baked stone, which he afterwards worked over with stucco; and with this material he made columns, bases, capitals, cornices, doors, windows and other things, all with most beautiful proportions. And he executed the decorations of the vaults in a new and fantastic manner, with very handsome compartments, and with richly adorned recesses. (...) The form of the palace is as follows: the building is quadrangular, and it has in the centre an open courtyard (...), two others [ entrances ] lead into various apartments, and these are all adorned with stucco-works and paintings.> Excerpt B - Introduction chap.

But finally, having caused chips of the whitest marble that could be found to be pounded and reduced to a fine powder, and then sifted, he mixed it with white lime of travertine, and discovered that thus he had secceeded without any doubt in making the stucco of ancients, with all that he had desired therein.> Excerpt D - Life of Giulio Romano painter [ vol. VI ] : <(...) from that room of Psyche one passes into another [ or Camera degli Stucchi ] full of doubles friezes with figures in low-relief, executed in stucco after the designs of Giulio by Francesco Primaticcio of Bologna, then a young man, and by Giovan Battista Mantovano, in which friezes are all the soldiers that are on Trajan’s column at Rome, wrought in a beautiful manner.> Excerpt E - Description of the works of Francesco Primaticcio (...) [ vol. IX ] : < [ Primaticcio ] going afterwards to Mantua, where at that time Giulio Romano was working at Palazzo Te. There, (...) he learned very well (...) to work in stucco (...).

However, the specific nature of the reactive phases in such binders is rarely clearly identified, particularly when different degradation or weathering patterns, frequently related to the carbonation of the binder, interact with dissolution and precipitation reactions. The question of which binder and aggregate components have contributed to the hydraulicity of a given historic mortar, a key to a better understanding of ancient technologies, is frequently not investigated in the case of mortars which underwent the above mentioned alteration processes. Microscopy provides a powerful analytical technique to determine the type of binders and differentiate between primary and alteration phenomena. By the example of three groups of binders, namely Roman opus caementitium/cocciopesto mortars from Ephesus (Asia Minor) and Vindobona (Roman Vienna), a 16th C. Ottoman horasan masonry mortar from Budapest, and 19th C. highly hydraulic lime filling mortars from Switzerland, the present article discusses two phenomena frequently observed when dealing with ancient hydraulic mortars: firstly as to the source(s) of hydraulicity of the mortar and secondly, that after a long period of time exposed to moist environments, the binder tends to present an inhomogeneous composition of an impure silica gel separated from calcium carbonate, accompanied by leaching and precipitation of binder constituents. These two phenomena are illustrated by polarized light microscopy (PLM) and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and discussed in light of both conservation and understanding of ancient structures as well as how it can be applied to the current issues of alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) and leaching in modern concretes. Keywords: historical mortar, hydraulicity, carbonation, leaching, AAR I. Introduction / Methodology PLM and SEM-EDX are powerful tools when study- ing historical mortar samples, especially when used in conjunction on the same polished thin sec- tion. This is particularly true when observing the binder and binder-aggregate interaction. While PLM is a quick and convenient first step to visu- alizing reactive areas, characterizing the reactions and phases involved requires additional instrumen- tal techniques such as SEM-EDX. This research presents two of these observations made from com- bining these techniques as applied to various types of mortar. One focuses on the potential of siliceous aggregates generally considered inert to contribute to the overall hydraulicity of a mortar; the other on the alteration of highly hydraulic binders, espe- cially evident in applications where the mortar was used in highly humid conditions. Studying these two phenomena is not only useful in the histori- cal or archeological context, but should further the understanding of such issues as alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) in contemporary structures. The issue of reactive aggregate was observed across a wide variety of sample types, all of which additionally show signs of binder alteration linked to carbonation and leaching. How these phenom- ena could be linked will be discussed in the con- clusion. Presented here are a number of mortar samples from ancient Roman sites, an Ottoman-era bath from Budapest and a highly hydraulic mortar from the turn of the 20 th century. Cocciopesto mor- tars (such as those from the Roman era discussed here) have been well researched in terms of the interaction at the interface between ceramic frag- ments and the lime binder; what is presented here is the observation that the binder itself is highly hy- draulic throughout, evidence that either the binder 147 Weber et al. pairment of the section by coating, most of the sam- ples were analyzed uncoated under low-vacuum conditions of the SEM. Since the EDX results were supposed to be less accurate at low vacuum, quan- titative data of analysis are to be handled with care. This does not apply to the data plotted in the graph of Figure 17, which were measured on carbon-coated samples at high vacuum at 15 kV. II. Figure 1: 90-day old experimental cocciopesto mortar; beside the larger ceramic fragments, a large amount of fines are visible as red particles. Incident light, white background. has an additional source of hydraulic material, or that a much larger amount of the aggregate has reacted than previously observed. Similar high hy- draulicity has been observed in mortars with little or no ceramic aggregate and no obvious primary silica source from the binder itself. The example of the early 20 th century restoration mortar shows that these phenomena are observable in much younger mortar, potentially forming a bridge between ob- servations on ancient mortar and issues seen in construction today. Most of the micrographs presented and discussed in this study were obtained from polished thin sec- tions produced after vacuum impregnating mortar samples with blue-dyed epoxy resin. Once a struc- ture was observed by polarizing light microscopy (PLM) in the transmitted and incident modes, care was taken to study the same structure in the scan- ning electron microscope (SEM) at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. In order to avoid irreversible im- Historical samples discussed Late Republican/ Early Imperial Roman mortar from Ephesus, Turkey and Sisak, Croatia One of the largest cities in the Eastern Mediter- ranean in ancient times, Ephesus was the capital of the province of Asia during the Roman Empire. Designed for approx. 25,000 spectators, the Roman theater was constructed and enlarged in several steps between the 1 st and the 4 th century A.D. The samples presented in this study come from various construction phases and parts of the building and comprise both opus caementitium and masonry mortars. The composition of these mortars did not show any significant difference in dependence to phase or mode of application. Additionally ana- lyzed is a masonry mortar from Sisak (Siscia), Croa- tia, an important center of Southern Pannonia in Roman times. All mortars faced similar conditions of exposure in the interior of ancient walls which were later on buried until their excavation. Early Imperial Roman mortar from Vi- enna, Austria The Vienna Basin was controlled by the Roman Em- pire from roughly the turn of the first century until the early 5 th century A.D. as part of the province of Figure 2: Sample as Figure 1; (a) Interior of brick fragment rich in mica and fine quartz.

(a) Observed by PLM at incident light in the dark field mode, the brick fragment seems unreacted.(b) The bright field appearance of the same fragment evidences its high degree of dissolution.(c) The same fragment by SEM-BSE confirms that a significant amount of the ceramic fragment has undergone reaction; while quartz and mica have remained in the otherwise hydrated core part of the fragment, only quartz is present in the surrounding hydrate matrix where mica has apparently reacted away. The binder is altered to a silica-rich gel with popcorn like tiny crystals of calcium carbonate. Patchy compaction, very evident in the PLM micrographs by bright colors, is due to precipitation of a Mg-rich carbonate phase. Pannonia. A legionary fortress called Vindobona, surrounded by a civilian settlement, was built at the current site of the innermost district of Vienna. To supply this city with fresh water, an aqueduct was built leading from the nearby hills. The sample discussed is of the cocciopesto lining of this aque- duct and includes a thick layer of accreted calcium carbonate from centuries of use. In the course of studying this mortar, experimental mortar of simi- lar composition was made for comparison. Mortar was prepared in the proportion of 1 part lime to 3 parts aggregate (based on Vitruvius), with a portion of the aggregate being ceramic, and the other por- tion being siliceous (based on observed historical mortar compositions). 16 th C. Ottoman mortar from Budapest, Hungary Between 1526 and 1686, part of the Hungarian King- dom was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. During this time, many buildings were constructed, includ- ing thermal baths. One of the largest Ottoman baths in Budapest, the Császár (Emperor) Bath, was built in 1574 by Sokollu Mustafa and has been rebuilt several times in the following centuries. During renovation-restoration activities of the bath, several samples have been taken in order to support art historical and scientific research (Pintér et al, 2011). The sample presented in this study is a lime-brick horasan bedding mortar of a water pipeline orig- inating from the western part of the central bath building. 19 th C. Restoration mortar of a Swiss Ro- man site Aventicum, the capital of the Helvetians, was built in the early first century A.D. It grew considerably during the reign of Emperor Vespasian, who in 72 AD gave it the rank of colony. It was during this period that the imposing city wall (5.5 km) was built. The East Gate of this wall dominated the city and indicated the general direction of a transit route through several roads delimitated by adjacent walls. Almost completely razed to the ground, the gate and the walls were partly rebuilt during the restoration campaigns of the East Gate and the For- tification Wall (1910-1940), under the direction of the archaeologist Louis Bosset. The original Roman wall core was conserved and protected by a new wall over two meters high. The present sample has been collected from the filling joints of internal lime- stone rubbles of the wall n 8, the external masonry being composed of limestone joined ashlar. Cocciopesto/horasan mortars Figure 4: Apparently calcium-rich area within brick (framed); Vindobona Aqueduct. Transmitted light, dark field. The ability of ceramic fragments or powder to im- prove the strength of a mortar, generically known as cocciopesto (called horasan in the case of Ot- 149 Weber et al.

(b) Framed area from Figure 5a: C 2 S with hydration rim. toman mortars), is well known as a result of being recommended by Vitruvius. A number of recent pa- pers have contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms involved, confirming the good mechan- ical performance and durability of these mortars [ e.g. (Baronia & Binda, 1996); (Baronio et al, 1996); (Binda et al, 1999); (Böke et al, 2006); (Moropoulou et al, 2002); (Silva et al, 2007); (Nezerka et al, 2015) ] . The strength enhancing reaction at the ceramic-lime interface is easily observable through microscopy. main reactive portion of a brick consists of dehy- droxilated clay (Cultrone at al., 2001). When these residuals are found within the matrix, there is a ten- dency to oversee them or assume that they are part of the additional aggregate or the original binder, perhaps leading to an inaccurate assessment of the binder-aggregate ratio. These unreacted trace min- erals leave a fingerprint of former ceramic aggre- gates, such as reddish areas visible in PLM (Figures 3 and 4). It is the contention of this paper that it can be assumed that the same reaction is taking place on the ceramic fines within the binder matrix, indeed to greater extent due to their greater surface area in contact with lime. Over time, these smaller particles would mainly become invisible, leaving only ves- tiges such as iron oxide, quartz or mica as the clay minerals have reacted (Figures 1,2), interspersed within a highly altered binder of silica gel and com- pacted calcium carbonate (discussed below). As is well known and stated by numerous authors, the However, there exist other potentially reactive constituents including calcium silicates formed dur- ing the firing of lime-rich bricks as well as other reactive silicate minerals included in the temper that may contribute to the overall hydraulicity of a mortar (Figures 4-6). The presence of partially hy- drated silicates completely enclosed within a brick fragment lends credence to the idea that such phe- nomena would likely occur as well in the matrix. These cases exhibit the potential for additional ob- servable hydraulicity in cocciopesto mortar beyond Figure 6: SEM-BSE of the interior of a brick fragment showing reactive albite with silica-rich hydration rim, Ephesus Theater. 150 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 7: Ancient highly hydraulic masonry mortar with almost no ceramic aggregate from Ephesus Theater.

Other highly hydraulic ancient mortars There exist instances of ancient mortars in which neither brick powder nor volcanic pozzolans are present in sufficient quantity to explain the observ- able high hydraulicity, nor infer that they were in- tentionally added for this purpose. One possibil- ity is that a hydraulic lime was used, however in this case generally remnants of the lime source can be found, for example marly lime lumps or un- hydrated calcium silicates. The other possibility rarely discussed is that of reactive aggregates. Un- der certain conditions, plagioclase, feldspar, chert and potentially even quartz can react, releasing silicate into the binder and contributing to the over- all hydraulicity (Chou & Wollast, 1985; Hodgkin- son & Hughes, 1999; Broekmans, 2004). These are identifiable by a similar reaction ring that can be found around a pozzolan (Figures 7-11). As is the case with ceramic aggregate, over time only the larger aggregates would be visible, while the finer portion could be easily overseen or would be completely reacted away. While not commonly dis- cussed in literature on historical mortars, a similar phenomenon is discussed in works on alkali-silicate reaction (ASR), a type of alkali-aggregate reaction in OPC based concrete. The conditions known to fa- vor ASR are lattice defects and/or low crystallinity in SiO 2 , high humidity over prolonged periods of time, sufficiently high pH and alkali content. At least some of these conditions can be present in historical mortars, especially when used in appli- cations that expose them to high humidity such as masonry filling mortars - e.g. opus caementitium, hypocaust floors etc. Other observations support- ing the idea that the conditions were in favor of the hydration of otherwise stable silicate minerals Figure 8: A similarly ancient highly hydraulic masonry mortar with almost no ceramic aggregate from Ephesus Theater.

(2011), indicating elevated pH. An explanation for alkaline conditions that would favor dissolution of feldspar over a long period of time are a slow rate of carbonation due to limited exposure to the atmosphere in the case of the men- tioned types of application. The condition of high humidity over prolonged periods of time is also evidenced by strong alteration of the binder matrix. It is likely that under such conditions even quartz, especially the metamorphic quartzes generally ob- served in all of the mortars presented here, may be subject to dissolution at low rates.

Alteration of highly hydraulic binder The carbonation of hydrates constituting the matrix of hydraulic binders is a well-known fact attested to by a large amount of studies such as Goto et al. (1995). Much knowledge comes from research on concrete and modern cementitious materials; how- ever, it is naturally applicable to hydraulic binders in historical mortar. Binder alteration linked to car- bonation is reflected by a number of interesting phenomena observable in the microstructure, in particular when using appropriate modes of illumi- nation under an optical microscope, in particular dark-field mode. The areas thus discovered can then be chemically analyzed with EDX, but it is im- portant to remember that because of inhomogeneity, it is not possible to access the quantitative composi- tion of the binder in this way. The process of carbon- ation is system-wide: not only is calcium hydroxide converted to calcium carbonate, but calcium silicate hydrates are likewise converted to calcium carbon- ate and a silica-rich gel. In cement mortars, the depletion in calcium, which forms compact rims of carbonate around the clinker, drastically alters the composition of calcium silicates in unhydrated clinker residues [ e.g. Shtepenko et al. (2006), Gos- selin et al. (2012) ] . When carbonation is accompa- nied or followed by the circulation of water through the pore system of the binder, calcium carbonate can get dissolved and re-precipitated in specific places. When these conditions are met, this may lead either to "popcorn" like crystals of calcium car- bonate growing within a silica-rich matrix (Figures 14a and b), often combined with re-crystallization along the margin of pores and cracks, or to the development of diffuse binder areas compacted by submicroscopic carbonate crystals. This effect is a clear evidence for degraded C-S-H due to strong leaching caused by percolating water. Additionally this can also be observed in more modern materi- als such as an early 20 th Century highly hydraulic lime mortar (Figure 15). In this example a belite clinker nodule has separated into silicate and car- bonate rich areas. The described phenomena are well-known for modern concretes. It is important to reiterate that as in the question of additional reactive aggregates, this phenomenon is particu- larly evident in building applications that featured a large amount of moisture or humidity. From published XRD data we know that this secondary calcium carbonate, intermixed with de- calcified C-S-H, frequently occurs as aragonite or vaterite (Elsen et al, 2012). In either case is the remaining binder, a chemically impure silica gel, strongly depleted of calcium. Though the described inhomogeneity makes it impossible to assess the original binder composition by EDX or other meth- Figure 12: Ancient highly hydraulic opus caementitium mortar from Ephesus Theater.

It is worth mention- ing in this context that the described process of alteration is usually resulting in increased strength and durability of the historical mortars affected. Observations of the microstructure by microscopy and SEM generally support this fact: in contrast to the destructive effect of gel formation by AAR in modern concrete, silica gel formed in the course of carbonation of ancient hydraulic binders seems to form a fairly porous structure, chemically stable and not subject to volume expansion. The pre- cipitation of carbonate on the other hand, though creating inhomogeneous patterns of compaction as described above, is yielding additional strength since it is likely to crystallize in weak and porous zones of the mortar, thus contributing to the so- called self-healing effect, a term frequently cited as advantageous of lime mortars (e.g. Borges et al., 2014), even if their inhomogeneity is enhanced which can cause the formation of weaker binder depleted areas In this way, the adhesion between binder and aggregates is usually strengthened due to preferential carbonate crystallization in fissures and voids between these two systems. In the case of porous aggregates such as brick fragments, the precipitation of calcium carbonate affects also the marginal zones of the aggregate, binding it tightly to the matrix (Nežerka et al, 2015). The latter effect yields a zoning of the brick often visible even by the naked eye, and can be easily misinterpreted as a reaction rim of hydrates. Both phenomena, how- ever, are likely to improve the mortar strength in a similar way. III. Conclusion The wide variety of mortar samples discussed here share two common traits: that they have additional, unexpected observable hydraulicity not attributable to silicate phase in the raw feed (e.g. hydraulic lime) and that this hydraulic binder has drastically altered over time, as manifest by a silica-rich gel with clustered carbonate areas. These observations Figure 14: Horasan mortar from the Emperor‘s Bath, Budapest. Both PLM (a) and SEM-BSE (b) clearly show CaCO 3 "popcorn". EDX confirms that the binder is composed of this and impure and amorphous silica gel. White cracks are filled with re-crystallized CaCO 3 . Small red fragments are remnants of reacted ceramic particles added as a pozzolan. 154 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 15: (a) Alteration of belite clinker remnant used to repair the Swiss Roman site of Aventicum(b) Image showing silica gel interspersed within matrix near clinker. SEM-BSE. were not the initial goal of analysis of any of the samples; rather the similarities were discovered in- dependently. Hydraulicity in each of the historical samples was enhanced by reactive aggregates, tem- pered and untempered, ceramic or natural. Despite these similarities, and the similarities of the silica gel and carbonate binder separation phenomenon, one must keep in mind that the rate of these reac- tions are not necessarily the same across all samples. One thing that all ancient mortars had in common was high exposure to humidity and probably a high pH over prolonged periods of time. As a matter of fact, both phenomena were ob- served in the same mortar samples, because the extensive binder alteration of the described type can only occur in hydraulic mortar. Frequently found in ancient renders and plasters, the effect of binder dissolution and precipitation in air lime mortars is known to result in the re-distribution of the carbonate binder where, however, no dissolu- tion of silicate aggregate is observed. This points to the necessity of a prolonged alkalinity in the ser- vice life of a mortar, a condition enhanced by high humidity as is the case for filling mortar and water pipes, water buildings, etc. It is evident that feldspars would form alkalis upon their dissolution, thus adding a source of high pH at least in their immediate surroundings. In this way, a self-sustaining cycle of feldspar dissolution could be assumed. It would continue to operate un- til the alkalis get washed out and leave the system, which would allow carbonation. Whether or not this proposed mechanism can have played a role for the whole bulk of the mortar binder is under question at this stage of research. This work represents a preliminary set of ob- servations regarding important chemical processes and how they apply to the durability of ancient Figure 16: Aventicum mortar, morphology of the cement grains (original quartz core and C 2 S rim) showing inner and outer hydration products discriminated by a hollow shell. 155 Weber et al.

The lessons that can be learned from this study and how they can be applied to the issues of conservation as well as to contemporary build- ings require further clarification. Microscopy is an important starting point that should be followed by the use of other analytical techniques such as Raman microscopy. Additional studies on exper- imental mortars to establish e.g. the potential of feldspar dissolution to create sufficient alkaline con- ditions would include analyses of pore solutions as well as of alkali and feldspar contents, respectively.

This phenomenon is expressed by the filling of micro-cracks by secondary products, restoring or enhancing the material’s performance. The reactions that take place inside the cracks can be either carbonation or hydration, producing secondary calcite or hydraulic phases respectively. Overall, the "healing" potential of a cementitious material is largely governed by the binder composition, as well as the morphology, chemistry and mineralogy of the healing products. As it is an autogenic phenomenon, the main interest lies in a deeper understanding of its mechanism, along with the parameters that may promote or hinder it. In the present study the autogenic self healing phenomenon was studied in lime-pozzolan and natural hydraulic (NHL) mortars, considering aspects of binder composition, curing time before initial cracking, duration and conditions of the healing period. In order to parameterize the phenomenon, prismatic specimens of both compositions were cracked after 15 and 30 days of curing and were then examined after another 30 or 90 days of curing at different environmental conditions(45, 75, 95 RH %) or after continuous wet-dry cycles. The identification of the secondary formed products was carried out on thin-sections and fractured surfaces, in Petrographic and Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy Dispersive X-rays Analyser (SEM/EDAX), based on their optical properties, micro-morphology and chemical composition of the new phases. Additionally, thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTA/TG) was performed in all specimens in order to quantitatively assess the available unreacted components in the binder at all ages. The main products formed during healing consist of calcite, aragonite and various C-S-H/ C-A-H phases. Depending on the parameters mentioned above, there is wide diversity in the intensity, typology and topography of the secondary phases inside the cracks. The main differences discussed, were observed between specimens cracked at very early age (7 days) and those damaged after 30 days of curing. These differences were correlated with the available each-time amount of lime, determined by thermo-gravimetric analysis, which found to be related to the formation of carbonate or hydraulic phases. Regarding the humidity conditions, it was observed that secondary phases may also be formed even at the lower humidity levels, while prolonged healing period doesn’t necessarily lead to higher healing efficiency. Keywords: self-healing, NHL, lime-pozzolan mortars, petrography, electron microscopy I. Introduction Lime-based mortars are extremely susceptible to crack generation since their first days of applica- tion. These cracks, even not macroscopically visible, could lead to further degradation and decreased durability, as micro-cracks make the structure more vulnerable to both mechanical stress and environ- mental actions. Therefore, the prolonged durability of historic lime-based mortars applied centuries ago, is often attributed to their self-healing capac- ity (Nijland, 2007). This phenomenon is autogenic, which means that these materials have the ability to heal micro-defects in their microstructure by fill- ing the cracks with their own generic materials. A simplified description of the phenomenon involves carbonation and hydration mechanisms (Edvarsen, 1999); cracks are filled with calcium carbonate or hydration products, which derive either from the carbonation of calcium hydroxide or by further re- action of non-hydrated phases inside the mortar matrix respectively. The potential of self-healing is a favorable function of modern building materials, since they could greatly enhance the service-life and durability of constructions and thus, reduce the need for intervention or restoration of struc- tures (Breugel, 2012). Although, in order to pro- duce engineered self-healing materials, a deeper understanding of the phenomenon is imperative. For instance, the presence of water, which is a crucial parameter of the self-healing phenomenon (Hearn, 1998) (Yang, 2009), varies in the natural environment of structures. It could be present in excess e.g. in underwater structures, or at different RH levels as atmospheric humidity or through cap- illary actions. An additional parameter that should 157 Amenta et al.

Today, it is not yet entirely un- derstood whether this phenomenon can take place only in the first stage of a mortar life (Schlangen, 2006) when there still are unreacted components, or whether it is possible to be the result of sec- ondary dissolution and re-precipitation of hydra- tion or carbonation products. Another question is related to the age of the specimen when cracking occurs (Hearn, 1997). As Ca-bearing phases exhibit a range of solubility values (depending always on the pH and temperature of the pore solution), it is expected that self-healing ability of a mixture will also depend on the stage of carbonation and/or hydration progress in the binder matrix. During carbonation, portlandite is transformed into calcite which is a much less soluble mineral. In hydraulic binders the produced C-S-H and C-A-H phases are also susceptible to dissolution but, as they are less soluble than portlandite, the dissociation of Ca begins after the dissolution of the latter (Adenot, 1991). With respect to the theoretical assumption that chemical reactions take place inside the crack space described earlier, an important parameter to 158 Healing/ curing period (d) 30 30 30 30 90 90 90 90 30 30 30 30 90 90 90 90 30 30 30 30 90 90 90 90 30 30 30 30 90 90 90 90 be studied is the availability of the chemical species involved. More specifically the concentration of cal- cium ions in the pore solution should be a decisive factor since the carbonate content is not a limiting factor (Edvardsen, 1999). Water could contain a small concentration of calcium ions but in order saturation to be achieved the main source of cal- cium would be the calcium-baring components of the binder. In the study of Huang and Ye (Huang, 2014) was found that the mineralogy of the reac- tion products of self-healing induced with saturated Ca ( OH ) 2 solution is similar to that caused by dis- tilled water, but the efficiency was improved. This suggests that calcium ions play the most significant role on the evolution of the autogenic phenomenon. Therefore, the characterization of the healing products is of prime importance as it constitutes the first step towards the comprehension of the auto- genous phenomenon. Calcium carbonate has been identified as the main secondary product filling the crack by several studies as well as the presence of portlandite (Lauer, 1956) (Lubelli, 2011). At the same time, hydration has also been reported as a self-healing mechanism with ettringite (Jacobsen, 1995). It is clear that the morphology of secondary products has not been sufficiently studied and cor- 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 1: Sample preparation for SEM and polarizing light microscope.

Aiming to contribute on the systematic attempt to parameterize the autogenic phenomenon of lime- based mortars, this study, mainly focuses on the microscopic examination for assessing the morphol- ogy of the secondary formed self-healing prod- ucts. To this end, lime-pozzolan and natural hy- draulic lime mixtures were deliberately damaged and cured under varying climatic conditions in order to identify the secondary products that are formed under different curing conditions. II. Materials and methods The two different mortars mixes prepared and stud- ied (NHL and lime-pozzolan) are considered typi- cal traditional materials, similar to those used from the Roman period to the end of the last century. Nowadays, they are mostly used in restoration interventions because of their compatibility with the original historic materials. The raw materi- als used for this study were a commercially avail- able lime powder (KRINOS SA) mixed with a nat- Figure 2: Normalized Ca ( OH ) 2 amount (wt%) in NHL and LP mixtures, determined by DTA/TG. ural pozzolan of volcanic origin (Dalkafoukis) in a 1:1 ratio (LP-mixtures) and NHL5 by St.Astier (NHL-mixtures). In both mixes siliceous standard sand (EN196-1) was added as aggregate with a ce- ment/aggregate ratio of 1:3 w/w. Prismatic specimens (15 ⇥ 15 ⇥ 80 mm) of each mortar mixture (n=48) were cast and cured in con- trolled conditions (95% RH, 20 C). In order to study the healing mechanisms, the specimens were damaged by controlled cracking, under three point bending. A continuous load (100 µm/min) was ap- plied to all specimens, allowing the deformation of specimens up to 50 µm after crack initiation. The characteristics of the cracks produced, was deter- mined by means of optical microscopy. The spec- imens were then divided in 16 groups of 3. In each group one parameter was examined (age of the specimens at the time of the crack formation, conditions of healing and healing period), as listed in Table 1. The composition of all mixtures was assessed after varying curing periods with thermal analysis (DTA/TG) by a Perkin Elmer Pyris G2. Figure 3: Chemical analysis of the secondary products performed by EDAX revealed the two main groups formed in the examined specimens. 159 Amenta et al. Figure 4: Typical patterns of calcium carbonate formations of varying size and morphology. The elemental composition of the products was identified by EDAX. The amount of portlandite (wt%) was monitored and correlated with the age of the specimens, when cracking was introduced. Healing Conditions Cracked specimens were cured in four different en- vironments, in order to simulate varying outdoor conditions. One group was subjected to wet-dry cy- cles, which refer to an outdoor environment where masonry is subjected to rainy days followed by a period of drying. The specimens were immersing in water for 24 hours and letting them afterwards to dry for two days in laboratory conditions (25 ± 5 C, 45 ± 55%RH). These specimens were examined af- ter 10 and 30 cycles (30 and 90 days respectively). Furthermore, three humidity levels were selected in order to understand the effect of relative humid- ity on the self-healing mechanism. Lower humidity (45%RH) could refer in an indoor environment or in an outdoor environment during the summer when long and relatively dry periods take place. Higher humidity levels are met often in exterior masonry in areas not directly subjected to rainfall but could also refer to indoor masonry that is not heated.

LP3030cy hydration products formed after ten wet-dry cycles (right). Sample preparation At the end of each healing period the speci- mens were used for the examination of the sec- ondary products formed inside the cracks, in a FEI Quanta-Inspect Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDAX). Microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for the characterization of cementi- tious materials and its proven to be a useful tool in the assessment of both damage degree and healing capacity of these materials (Çopuroğlu, 2013). Vari- ous microscopy techniques provide insight concern- ing different aspects of the problem. The examina- tion of thin sections at the petrographic microscope is the main technique for the characterization of primary and secondary reaction products (Lubelli, 2012), as well as for the quantification of the sec- ondary phases inside the crack. Scanning Electron microscopy provides the option of examining frac- tured surfaces of samples due to its ability to obtain large depth of field thus making it possible to ex- amine the crack surface and characterize secondary precipitates or reaction products in great detail. Ad- ditionally, when SEM is combined with EDAX it may be proved useful in the characterization of dis- tinct points of a polished section by quantitative chemical analysis. The use of the above techniques, especially when they are combined, constitutes an important asset in the study of the mechanism of self-healing. One specimen was used for the characterization of the secondary products morphology by exami- nation of the crack surface (Figure 1). In order to obtain supplementary information regarding the topography of the secondary products inside the cracks, a cross-section of the crack was examined. For this reason two specimens were impregnated under vacuum in epoxy resin to produce thin and polished sections of the crack plane (Figure 1). III. Results and discussion The hardening of NHL and lime-pozzolan mortars is basically controlled by two main mechanisms, Figure 7: "Bee-hive" formations, commonly found in NHL and LP (left) mortars. These gel-like products are in all cases encountered in flat plains, e.g. in the area that was between binder and aggregate. Higher magnification reveals its gel-like morphology (right). 161 Amenta et al. M. Amenta et al. Concerning the effect of humidity level, in samples cured at 45%RH (regardless of their composition, age of cracking and healing period), no secondary products were observed. In the specimens cured at 75%RH, the secondary products were scarce in NHL mortars, whereas LP mortars revealed an abundance of both crystalline and gel-like secondary phases (Fig.8 left). This was also confirmed during the examination of the polished surfaces (Fig.8 right). The above findings highlight the critical role of water and aqueous solutions in the hydration of hydraulic binders and the development of the healing mechanism. The presence of water is crucial for the development of carbonation and hydration mechanisms (Cizer, 2012) (Karatasios, 2012). Optimum conditions for the carbonation reaction are met in high humidity levels, whereas when pore space is completely dry or fully saturated, carbonation is inhibited (Moorehead, 1986). Figure 8: Microphotographs of LP303075. Hydration products formed along a smaller perpendicular crack (left) and a micro crack completely filled by calcite (right). hydration and carbonation. The concentration of portlandite in the binder can be used as an indica- tor of the progression of these mechanisms, as in both mixtures it is the main reactant. Portlandite was determined quantitatively in samples cured at 95% RH (Figure 2) by thermal analysis (DTA/TG). The Ca ( OH ) 2 content in both mixtures is reduced exponentially with curing time, but even after 60 days in high humidity environment there is still a considerable amount detected. which seem to be richer in aluminum. In contrast, secondary products in LP specimens exhibited a very narrow distribution in regard to Al/Si ratio, whereas a clear separation as to Ca/Si ratio (crystal vs gel-like products). The occurrence of different healing products varies within the samples examined, but there are some repetitive patterns than can be recognized. More specifically, calcium carbonate is present in all samples. Calcite is formed on the outer part of the crack near the surface, similar to the results The observation of the crack surfaces at the SEM Figure 8: Microphotographs of LP303075.

IV. Conclusions Although complete healing of the main crack in- duced by three point bending, was not observed in any mixture, smaller side-cracks were completely filled with secondary products under specific each- time conditions. The study of crack surfaces under SEM revealed the presence of carbonates and a large variety of hydration products, depended on the initial com- position of the binder. The hydration products pro- duced in both NHL and LP mortars were mostly occupying smaller cracks, especially in the interface between binder and aggregates, while carbonation products were observed in larger cracks. At the humidity level of 75%, the healing prod- ucts were abundant in LP specimens, whereas in NHL were hardly spotted. Lower humidity con- ditions (45% RH) found to be inadequate for the evolution of the autogenous healing phenomenon to take place. Nevertheless, under these conditions a high percentage of unreacted components remain active in the mortar matrix, allowing a potential fu- ture initiation of the self-healing, when the proper conditions are reached. The effect of cracking age was a crucial parameter to the healing efficiency, since specimens cracked at early age displayed higher percentage of crack- healing than those cracked after one month of cur- ing. Finally, curing time was found to be of prime importance for early-age cracked specimens under- wet dry cycles, where additional curing time was found to have a substantial effect on the percentage of the cracks filled by precipitated calcite (both in LP and NHL mortars). In contrast, specimens cracked at later age showed little or none evolution of the phenomenon after the first ten cycles. 164 References Adenot, F., and M. Buil.

Wiktor ⇤ ,a,b , H.M. Jonkers a a Delft University of Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Section of Materials and Environment, Delft, The Netherlands. b Bartels Building Solutions, Apeldoorn, The Netherlands ⇤ v.a.c.wiktor@gmail.com Abstract Biodeposition, a method by which calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) precipitation is induced by bacteria, has been proposed as an interesting approach to protect building materials. The liquid-based system presented in this paper aims at the sealing of cracks and decrease of the porosity due to the production of a calcium-based biomineral. In this system, a silicate-based compound, which has a composition similar to concrete, is associated with Microbial Induced Precipitation (MIP), without involving urea hydrolysis pathway. Instead, the metabolic conversion of organic salts through bacterial respiration is used for MIP. The novelty of such system is to combine advantages of both, traditional repair system for concrete (fast reacting, and short term efficiency), and bio-based methods (more sustainable, slow process, and long-term efficiency). This paper presents how environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) has been used in the development of the bacteria-based repair system. It is a good evaluation technique to assess the functionality of the bacteria-based repair system and to evidence the involvement of bacteria in the mineral production. The functionality of the bacteria-based repair system has first been assessed in the repair system alone, and then after injection into porous concrete. These results bring more insight regarding the formation of the biomineral. Though the bacteria are active after 1 day, it requires longer time to indeed observe mineral formation. Several days are needed to bacteria to actively convert the feed and produce substantial amount of CO 2 , leading to favorable chemical environment for calcium carbonate precipitation. The results also showed how FTIR and ESEM analysis are complementary. Vaterite and calcite have been identified thank to FTIR while ESEM observation highlighted the unique features of the biomineral in size, shape and texture. Keywords: bacteria-based system, repair, concrete, biomineral, bacteria imprints I. Introduction The development of bacteria-based systems for the protection of concrete structures has gained lot of attention over the past few years. These systems, engineered for self-healing concrete or concrete re- pair (Dhami et al., 2012), are based on Microbial Induced Precipitation (MIP), a method by which calcium carbonate precipitation is induced by bac- teria. The system presented in this study is a liquid- based system for concrete repair aiming at the seal- ing of the cracks and decrease of the porosity due to the production of calcium-based biomineral. In this system, a silicate-based compound, which has a composition similar to concrete, is associated with MIP using metabolic conversion of organic salts through bacterial respiration. The system is com- posed of two solutions, named A and B, which form a gel when mixed together. This gel is strong enough to allow a rapid sealing of the crack and is also providing a suitable environment for the bacteria to precipitate calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). By the time the gel becomes too weak, a substan- tial amount of CaCO 3 has been precipitated to seal the crack. And while assessing the crack sealing efficiency of the system can easily be done through water permeability test, the investigation and proof of the bacterial involvement in the mineralization process is not an easy task. Indeed, the basic principle behind the proposed system is that organics (feed for bacteria) are effi- ciently converted by the bacteria into CO 2 . Due to the alkaline environment in the system, the CO 2 is in turn converted into carbonate ions CO 2 3 , which precipitate with the calcium present in the feed to form CaCO 3 (biomineral). Therefore, the perfor- mance of the proposed system is directly linked 165 Wiktor & Jonkers Figure 1: Details of the FTIR spectra from the powder obtained after filtration of the bacteria-based repair solution at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks.

However, after the crack has been successfully sealed, it is very delicate to determine whether the bacteria fa- cilitated the CaCO 3 formation or if it is simply a result of physico-chemical conditions in the crack micro-environment as for instance it can also result from natural carbonation of concrete. In that area, environmental scanning electron microscopy is a precious tool as it may enable the observation of the biomineral which is characterized by a unique feature: the presence of bacteria imprints. This paper presents how environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) has been used in the development of the bacteria-based repair system. It is a good evaluation technique to assess the func- tionality of the bacteria-based repair system and to evidence the involvement of bacteria in the mineral production. The functionality of the bacteria-based repair system has first been assessed in the repair system alone, and then after injection into porous concrete. II. Materials and methods Bacteria-based repair system The bacteria-based repair system is a liquid-based system which transports a bio-based agent into concrete. The bio-based agent is composed of con- crete compatible bacteria and feed which produces calcite-based minerals resulting in decreased poros- ity and sealing of the crack. The bacteria are from the genus Bacillus. They are added as endospores, dormant bacteria cells with characteristic compact 166 round shape, typically in the size range of 0.8-1µm. When the environmental conditions are favorable (presence of water, nutrients and oxygen) these en- dospores germinate and grow into vegetative bacte- rial cells. Vegetative cells of Bacillus are rod-shapes and micrometer size (Buczynski and Chafetz, 1993). The preparation and composition of the two so- lutions forming the repair system, solution A and solution B, is as described by Wiktor and Jonkers (2012). Briefly, it is composed of: (i) Solution A – Sodium-silicate (alkaline buffer), Sodium-gluconate (Carbon source for bacteria growth), alkaliphilic bacteria. (ii)Solution B – Calcium-nitrate (nitrate source for denitrification when O 2 is depleted and calcium for CaCO 3 precipitation), alkaliphilic bacteria. Biomineral formation in the bacteria-based sys- tem Previous results (Wiktor et al., 2013) have shown that the bacteria are active within 24h after the mix- ing of the two solutions and that efficient sealing of a crack is obtain after 6 weeks. However very little is known on the kinetic of the biomineral for- mation over these 6 weeks and whether the crack sealing is indeed due to MIP. The goal here is to follow in time the formation of the biomineral in the repair system. For this purpose, solution A and B are mixed together in small flasks and left in the lab at room temperature for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. At each time, the precipitate and gel are separated by filtration on a sintered-glass fil- ter (pore size 10-16µm), washed with demi-water, dried at 35 C, grinded, and further analysed with 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 2: ESEM pictures of the precipitate obtained after filtration from the bacteria-based repair solution at (a) 1 week, (b) 2 weeks, (c) 4 weeks, (d) 6 weeks and (e) 8 weeks.

Fourier-Transformed Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR) for mineral identification and analysed with ESEM (Philips XL30 Series) equipped with an Energy Dis- persive X-ray element analyzing system (EDS) to possibly observe bacteria imprints. The samples are not coated prior ESEM observation. FTIR spectra were collected on a Perkin–Elmer Spectrum 100 Series spectrometer equipped with universal Attenuated Total Reflexion (ATR) unit. The spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–600 cm 1 with 2 cm 1 resolution, and 32 scans were collected each time. The ATR analyses require very small amount of sample (<5 mg), and furthermore no preparation or dilution of the sample is needed. The FTIR was first calibrated for background signal scanning, and then the experimental sample scan- ning was conducted. The spectra were normalized in order to compare them. Biomineral formation in concrete-based material In order to assess the functionality of the bacteria- based repair system in the concrete environment the repair system has been injected into porous concrete. By using porous concrete, large volume of repair solution can be injected in the material and therefore results in many spots within one specimen where the biomineral can be formed. The injection of the bacteria-based repair solution and preparation of the porous concrete is as described by Sangadji and Schlangen (2012). Three weeks after the injection, the specimens are dried, and fully impregnated with low viscosity epoxy mixed with 1% by weight of hudson yel- low pigment prior to sawing along the longitudinal cross-section. After epoxy impregnation of the new exposed surface, polished sections were then pre- pared from each sample, by grinding with water 167 Wiktor & Jonkers Figure 3: Observation of polished section of porous concrete specimen prepared 3 weeks after injection of the bacteria- based repair system: (a) and (b) ESEM pictures, (c) and (d) Elemental mapping corresponding to (a) showing the silicon and calcium distribution respectively.

The polished sections were observed with ESEM and elemental mapping was acquired with the ESEM/EDS. The polished sections are not coated prior ESEM observation. III. Results and discussion Biomineral formation in the bacteria-based re- pair system solution The FTIR spectra (Figure 1) are indicative of the presence of calcium carbonate. The FTIR spectra of crystalline calcium carbonate polymorphs (cal- cite, aragonite and vaterite) have been extensively reported in the literature (Ghosh, 2001). Because of their different crystal structure, they can be discrim- inated using FTIR, a different spectrum is observed for each of the structural forms. The occurrence of the major vibrational bands specific to calcite are observed: the C-O asymmetric stretching vibration (n3), and the C-O out of plan bending vibration (n2) of carbonate centered at 1420 and 865cm 1 re- spectively. The C-O planar bending vibration (n4) centered at 712 cm 1 , which is also the least intense of the three, has not been distinctly observed as 168 it was probably overlapped by the peak present at 700 cm 1 and therefore not shown on figure 1. Peaks at 835 and 872 cm 1 are also observed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks. They decrease in time while the peak centered at 865 cm 1 is increasing. These peaks likely correspond to the C-O out of plan bending vibration (n2) of vaterite (Sato and Matsuda, 1968). After the FTIR analysis, the powder has been observed with the ESEM and the corresponding pictures are presented on figure 2. A change in the morphology of the particles is noted as the time increases. Indeed, at 1 week (Figure 2a), the parti- cles are arranged in small flaks with no distinctive structure neither well define edges. The presence of silicon and calcium as indicated by EDS analy- sis, and the presence the Si-O stretching vibration centered at 1000cm 1 on the FTIR spectra (data not shown) suggest that the powder obtained after 1 week is mainly composed by a form of calcium silicate. This calcium silicate results from the imme- diate reaction between the silicates present in the solution A and the calcium in solution B. At 2 weeks (Figure 2b) globular morphology (calcium-based) with small rod-like imprints are observed. These globular shapes become bigger in size and more structured as the time increases (Figure 2c-e) suggesting crystallization. Taking into 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands account that vaterite has been detected with FTIR at 1, 2 and 4 weeks and calcite has been detected at 4, 6 and 8 weeks, we can assume that the glob- ular morphologies are calcium carbonate, mainly in the form of vaterite in the first weeks turning into calcite from week 4. The globular morphol- ogy observed in the first weeks are characteristic of vaterite. However, at week 4, this morphology is very different from the typical rhombohedral mor- phology usually observed for calcite. This can be explained by the presence of organics in the sys- tem which are known to have a profound influence on the crystal shape and size. Interestingly, the rod-like imprints are randomly distributed over the crystal surface and their occurrence also increase with time. The shape and size of these imprints are in good agreement with those of bacteria suggest- ing them to be bacteria imprints rather than default in the crystal structure. This is a strong indication of the involvement of the bacteria in the calcium carbonate formation. Indeed, vegetative cells are characterized by rod-shaped structure whereas en- dospores (the form in which bacteria have been added) are smaller compact round cells (Buczynski and Chafetz, 1993). Moreover, a closer look at the globular particle surface (Figure 2f) shows that this morphology indeed seems to be the results of the assembly of small calcite crystals grown around the bacteria cells. Biomineral formation in concrete-based material After showing that the bacteria-based repair system is functional in solution, it is of prime importance to assess its functionality and behavior in concrete- based material. The Figure 3 show a polished sec- tion of a cross section of porous concrete specimen 3 weeks after it has been impregnated with the bacteria-based repair system. It can be seen from Figure 3a and b that the bond- ing between the epoxy and the specimen is not good as some epoxy seems to have scaled off from the surface. Considering that during the prepa- ration of the polished sections the grinding was performed with water and that each specimen has been in contact with the grinding paper and water for 60 min, it can be concluded that the food dis- solved resulting in holes what then appears as bad bonding between epoxy and the matrix. However, this “de-bonding” can serve as indicator of the pres- ence of food, and help to locate CaCO 3 formed due conversion of food by bacteria. Moreover, though morphological information is lost due to the polishing, the de-bonding around round particles (Figure 3b) reveals a globular mor- phology and bacteria imprints, similarly to the pre- vious ESEM observation suggesting that it is actu- ally the biomineral. The silicon and calcium map- ping (Figure 3 c and d) of the specimen indicate that these globules are calcium-based and are primar- ily formed in the vicinity of silicon based material possibly cement paste and silicates from the repair system where the pH is alkaline. Therefore con- sidering that the bacteria added to the system are alkaliphilic (grow at high pH) these observations support the assumption that the round calcium- based particles are probably calcium carbonate re- sulting from MIP. IV. Conclusion These results bring more insight regarding the for- mation of the biomineral. Though the bacteria are active after 1 day, it requires longer time to indeed observe mineral formation. Several days are needed to bacteria to actively convert the feed and pro- duce substantial amount of CO 2 , leading to favor- able chemical environment for calcium carbonate precipitation. The results also showed how FTIR and ESEM analysis are complementary. Vaterite and calcite have been identified thanks to FTIR while ESEM observation highlighted the unique features of the biomineral in size, shape and tex- ture. The presence of bacteria imprints gave strong indication on the bacterial involvement in the min- eral formation underlying the functionality of the bacteria-based repair system in solution as well as in cement-based material.

They lead to substantial inspection and repairing works which considerably increase the cost of some constructions. Self- healing of cracks could be a mean to significantly improve the durability of concrete structures and reduce reparation costs. Concrete’s intrinsic ability to heal, called autogenic healing, has been reported for many years. This natural process is being improved and supplemented for some years by promising engineered additions such as mineral additions, capsules containing healing agents, minerals producing bacteria, or fibres limiting the crack width. However, a deeper understanding of the natural phenomenon could help to design innovative healing solutions based on cementitious materials themselves and / or supplement the actual construction codes concerning their maximum allowable cracks widths for structures. In this study, self-healing phenomenon in concrete by calcite formation is studied in order to provide information about the sealing process which leads to an impermeability increase. Experimental works, based on water immersion, are conducted on pre-cracked specimens. A focus is put on the influence of initial curing and environmental healing conditions on the kinetics and the potential of the phenomenon (maximum healable crack width). A reactive transport model is proposed to add explanations for some observed features of the phenomenon and determine some of its influencing parameters. Experimentally, initial curing conditions have an important impact on the self-healing kinetics and potential as air cured specimens do not reduced healing properties. A new method consisting of immersing these mortar specimens in CO 2 enriched water is proposed to heal cracks that cannot heal in tap water. Numerically, some experimental observations are explained such as the end of the healing process which is probably due to the local decrease of porosity nearby the crack, leading to a very slow ionic transport from the matrix.

Introduction Cracks in concrete generate important inspection and repairing costs, especially for public services and governments. Some of them can seriously af- fect the durability and the stability of the structures because of ingress of harmful substances causing corrosion or leakage. Thus, self-healing concrete could be a mean to make important savings by decreasing direct costs due to monitoring, reabilita- tion or reparation, and indirect costs inherent with repairing works such as trafic jams (van Breugel, 2009; De Rooij et al., 2013). Moreover, self- healing solutions could help the design of structures with long term durability properties for future nuclear waste disposal for example. Self-healing can occur naturally, without any par- ticular additive, under favourable conditions with the continuous or alternate presence of water by lo- cal restart of hydration (Granger et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2013; Hilloulin et al., 2014a) or formation of healing products by reaction with the environment (mainly calcium carbonate from calcium in the con- crete and carbonate ions contained in water) (Clear, 1985; Edvardsen, 1999). Some studies have reported the predominance of the precipitation phenomenon 171 Hilloulin et al. in common concrete with a water-to-cement (w/c) ratio around 0.4 - 0.5 (Edvardsen, 1999; Ranaivo- manana et al., 2013). Natural healing, called ‘au- togenic’ healing, has been observed to be limited to cracks with a maximal width of around 100 – 200 µm (Clear, 1985; Edvardsen, 1999; Aldea et al., 2000; Reinhardt and Jooss, 2003). Due to this actual limitation, novel engineered techniques have been developed to maximize healing, such as embedded capsules/vascular system (Dry and McMillan, 1996; Li et al., 1998; Mihashi et al., 2000; Van Tittelboom et al., 2011; Hilloulin et al., 2015), or calcium car- bonate embedded bacteria production (Wiktor and Jonkers, 2011; Wang et al., 2014). Autogenic healing by further hydration has been studied by several researchers because of expected mechanical regains due to the creation of new cal- cium silicate hydrates (CSH) (Jacobsen and Sell- evold, 1996; Ter Heide, 2005; Granger et al., 2007; Ter Heide and Schlangen, 2007). A global recovery of stiffness can be achieved by further hydration but mechanical regain seem very limited when cal- cite is formed into the crack (van Tittelboom et al., 2012). However, the kinetics and the limits of the phenomenon are not totally understood. More experimental tests are needed to determine the in- trinsic characteristics of the healing products, with the ultimate goal to propose predictive models. Self- healing observation and monitoring, usually per- formed by optical microscope on the crack surface, needs to be supplemented by tomography (Fukuda et al., 2013) or non- destructive techniques (In et al., 2013; Hilloulin et al., 2014b), in order to de- scribe and quantify the filling of cracks inside the specimens. Up to now, only few models were developed to describe self-healing of concrete. Some mod- els were proposed to determine the amount of un- hydrated cement particles in concrete specimens considering w/c ratio and cement fineness which underlies the self-healing potential (He et al., 2007b; He et al., 2007a), or to calculate the amount of heal- ing product due to further hydration considering two crack modes (Lv and Chen, 2012; Lv and Chen, 2013). A model simulating further hydration by water release by a capsule in a crack using wa- ter transport theory, ion diffusion theory and ther- modynamics theory has been recently developed (Huang and Ye, 2012; Huang et al., 2014), while characterization of the healing products relatively low mechanical properties have been assessed at a mesoscopic scale (Hilloulin et al., 2013; Hilloulin et al., 2014a). However, these models do not invest which parameters mainly influence the creation of calcite at the concrete – water interface which is the mostly observed phenomenon, and cannot assess the self-healing extent, e.g. speed and potential. In this study, a reactive transport model has been 172 developed to simulate autogenic healing by calcium carbonate precipitation which seems to be the pre- dominant phenomenon in most of the cases (Van Tittelboom et al., 2012), with the aim to explain the influence of self-healing conditions and qualify the self-healing potential (i.e. maximum crack width closed) of a given composition regarding its cur- ing conditions. The qualitative numerical results from the model are compared with experimental observations aiming at studying the influence of the environmental and curing conditions on the phe- nomenon. New environmental healing conditions are proposed to increase and accelerate natural heal- ing efficiency by calcium carbonate precipitation. Moreover, the use of 3D microscope to observe the healing product has been employed in order to ob- tain informations on the volume it occupy. This observation gives indications on the reliability of classic 2D microscope use. II. Reactive transport model A 1-D reactive transport model has been developed in TOUGHREACT (Xu et al., 2012) to study the formation of mineral precipitations, especially cal- cite by reaction of carbonate ions from water in the crack and calcium from the cementitious matrix (from interstitial water, or due to degradation of portlandite and/or CSH). A mortar sample with a length of 5 mm with an initial porosity of 20 % discretised into 100 µm cells (and 50 µm cells at the surface) along the X direction, was considered in contact with 500-µm wide water filled zone at one side (representing the crack). Water, originally at pH = 7, was discretised into 100 µm cells in order to have access to the eventual quantity of precipitates formed. The boundary water cell which is not in contact with the sample had a higher simulation volume, e.g. several litres, in order to represent outside water far from the sample. This hypothesis was considered in order to not quickly saturate the whole water volume with calcium ions and calcite and induced approximately constant ion concentra- tions and therefore a constant pH of around 7 in this cell. Mortar was initially assumed saturated in order to focus on ionic diffusion and chemical reaction, so that water transport had no influence in the initial model. Also, a 2D version of the model was developed to study the influence of water flux parallel to the crack on the calcite precipitation. The 2D model was discretized over the Y axis, parallel direction to the crack, into 3 4-mm long cells in order to get an eventual influence of the water flux on the ionic concentrations and pH. Three water flux speeds were simulated: 0.3 µm/s, 3 µm/s and 30 µm/s. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Table 1: Ion species, solids and chemical reactions considered in the simulation.

Ion species present in interstitial mortar water were considerably reduced to only H + to calibrate pH and Ca 2 + determined during the first iteration closed to 20 mmol/l for uncar- bonated mortar, in order to obtain a reasonable running time, likely leading to a small overestima- tion of healing speed due to the shortage of alkali ions K + and Na + . Laboratory experiments have shown that modest reductions in porosity from chemical precipitation can cause large reductions in permeability in rocks (Vaughan, 1987), and in the case of self-healing, to a probable stop of the phenomenon due to the formation of a calcite layer decreasing the speed of an initially slow diffusion controlled process (Edvardsen, 1999) (compared with the first surface-controlled process). Recently, (Ducasse-Laeyrusse, 2014) experimented that heal- ing of carbonated mortars was slower than the one of uncarbonated specimens. He attributed this find- ing to the difficulty for ions from the matrix to cross the small calcite layer in the crack due to carbon- ation. Thus, we decided to compare simulations considering the influence of the porosity variation on flow or not. The influence of porosity changes on flow is taken into consideration by a decrease of the effective ion diffusivity D according to the ini- tial diffusivity D 0 , the tortuosity t and the porosity f: D = t ⇥ f ⇥ D 0 (2) Mineral precipitates considered in this study are calcite (CaCO 3 ) and portlandite (Ca(OH) 2 ) with equilibrium constant from Thermoddem (Blanc et al., 2012). The chemical reactions are described thanks to a set of mass balance equations (equa- tion 3, zero superscript indicates initial values) and equilibrium equations (equation 4): ( c j + c 0 j ) + Sn ( c m + c 0 m ) = 0 SI = log 10 ’ c n ⇥ g n = 0 K (3) (4) Where c j and c m represent the concentrations of, respectively, the primary species (ions) and miner- als, n the stoichiometric coefficients, g the Debye- Hückel activity coefficients, SI the saturation index and K the equilibrium constants of the considered reactions. Chemical reactions and equilibrium con- stants are summarized in Table 1. In order to model the effect of curing condi- tions on self-healing potential, simulations were conducted using lower portlandite volume fraction in the first cells of mortar in contact with water to reproduce a consequence of a drying phenomenon Figure 1: Influence of the healing conditions on the mean calcite layer thickness created during the first 3 days of healing. 173 Hilloulin et al.

(portlandite volume fraction of 0.1 instead of 0.2). Other simulations were led considering a higher porosity in this zone (20% instead of 10%). Various parameters can be studied to represent the healing conditions (calcium hydroxide satura- tion (Huang et al., 2013), wet/dry cycles (Yang et al., 2009). In this study, we focused on the concen- tration of carbonate ions in water and on eventual water fluxes. III. Experimental program Material and methods Mortar specimens (7 ⇥ 7 ⇥ 28 cm 3 ) with a w/c of 0.35 were mixed. Their composition is detailed in Table 2. After 24 h curing in sealed conditions at 20 C, specimens were demoulded. Further curing conditions were then applied: specimen from series C1 were cured at 20 C, 80% of relative humidity (RH) during 36 days (referred as ‘dry curing’), speci- men from series C2 were cured in sealed conditions at 20 C during 18 days and specimen from series C3 were cured in calcium hydroxide saturated wa- ter during 18 days at 20 C. Specimens were then cracked by mean of a crack mouth opening dis- placement (CMOD) controlled three-point bending test until the formation of a single crack with a targeted maximum width of around 100 µm for 5 series, or 300 µm for the 2 other series (large cracks later called ‘L’). After cracking, a first set of microscopic pic- tures from different specific locations all around the cracks were taken. Thus, initial crack width (w initial ) was determined in order to constitute ini- tial measurement for crack width monitoring. Spec- imens were then subjected to one of the following healing conditions: • immersion in tap water (H1), • immersion in tap water at equilibrium with air with a partial CO 2 pressure of 4 % and 65 % RH, referred as ‘CO 2 enriched water’ (H 2 ), Curing and healing conditions for all the speci- mens are detailed in Table 3 with the CMOD after unloading. Because the thickness of the healing product layer is limited by the initial crack width which thus influ- ences the comparison between two specimens that do not have exactly the same initial crack width, a fair comparison can be made using healing percent- ages as follows: HP t,% = w initial w t ⇥ 100 w initial (5) where w t represents the crack width at a given healing time. Spatial variability of crack filling fraction was quantified by extracting the maximum and minimum crack width which can be healed over different locations. Thus, different local crack widths have been monitored. In order to get informations on the spatial mor- phology and distribution of the healing product, two specimens were observed by 3D microscope Table 2: Mortar formulation.

Results on the influence of initial curing condi- tions Initial curing conditions have an important impact on self-healing potential. ‘Dry curing’ at 80 % RH limits considerably self-healing phenomenon as al- most no precipitation occurred during the water immersion stage (Figure 1). Observations were prolonged during two weeks and no precipitation was observed while immersed in tap water. Sealed curing and water curing preserve the self-healing potential, explaining why this curing conditions have been extensively studied in previous research works. Thus, structures which are not immersed are not likely to exhibit a natural self-healing ability and novels engineered techniques might be devel- oped. Healing capabilities of specimens cured in carbonated water (H2) are higher than the ones of specimens cured in tap water (H1). This faster heal- ing phenomenon could be attributed to the higher amount of carbonate ions. For specimens presenting a healing ability, the evolution of crack width over time can be moni- tored as illustrated in Figure 2. For a given loca- tion, the crack width gradually decrease over time. Affine or linear regression coefficients, depending if there are some healed cracks or not, give an indica- tion of the global healing trend and can be used as a criterium to compare healing after different periods. The coefficient of determination gradually decrease with time which indicates the increasing of healing variability as the crack heals at some locations and does not heal at other locations as illustrated by Figure 3. This increasing spatial variability could be explained by the creation of preferential seed- ing zones for the healing products which could be related to higher ionic concentrations. Results on the influence of healing conditions As illustrated in Figure 4, specimens which were dry cured (C1) did almost not heal while the spec- imen cured in the same condition immersed in carbonated water almost completely healed within some days, with the formation of a white cubic precipitate on the entire mortar surface. However, dry cured specimens (C1) show an increasing trend in healing product thickness while healing product thickness is almost constant after 50 h for the other specimens. One should also observe on Figure 4 b) that crystals extend relatively far from the crack tra- ducing the occurrence of the carbonation reaction at a lower speed far from the crack. Immersion in carbonated water increases the speed of healing and also leads to a higher max- imum healable crack width as illustrated by the Figure 5a which compares the evolution of the thick- ness of the calcite layer for specimen C1-H1 and C1-H2. From Figure 5b representing the healing percentage for these two specimens after 48 h, one can see that all healing percentage of specimen C1- H2 is higher than the one of C1-H1 after 48h. It is worth to note that the healing potential is almost constant for the different crack widths monitored in this study. However, the healing potential should Figure 3: Microscopic observation of the healing spa- tial variability: specimen C1-H2 after 48h healing with visible healing product bridges. 175 Hilloulin et al.

Figure 6: 3D reconstruction of photonic images of a healed specimen (a) and an unhealed specimen with a crack width of around 90 µm (b). Void (blank) zones are due non convergence in the investigated range of ± 200 µm from the surface. Observations using 3D microscope The use of 3D microscope helps the observation of the healing product inside the crack as illustrated in Figure 6a. On the other hand, it seems difficult to get information on the crack lips geometry as the in- vestigated range is smaller than the effective depth of the crack (Figure 6b). Thus, a clear difference can be made between a healed and an unhealed specimen using 3D microscope. 3D microscopy reveals that the healing product forms a continued layer inside the crack but with a variable thickness (Figure 7). At most of the loca- tions, the healing product exits from the crack and can be easily detected. However, at some locations where it cannot be observed using naked eyes or 2D microscope, the healing product is generally present inside the crack at a depth of some dozens of microns. The microscopic observations reveal a lot of in- formation on the healing process but they are lim- ited to a qualification of the healing zone and to a steady-state measurement. The modelling could be add to these observations in order to quantify the components into the healing zone and to follow the healing kinetic. IV. Modelling results Influence of modelling parameters Figure 5: Microscopic monitoring results for specimens C1-H1 and C1-H2 after 48h healing: (a) self-healing product thickness, (b) healing percentage. 176 CSH degradation is not well reproduced by the thermodynamic database: CSH with a C/S ratio of 1.7 is directly degraded to amorphous silica which leads to a considerable increase of porosity. The 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands calcite formation calculated by the model is almost the same for a mortar with a portlandite content of 20%, and a mortar with a volume fraction of both 10% CSH and portlandite. The model repro- duces the pH drop after complete leaching. pH thus gradually decreases from a value close to 13 inside the mortar until the boundary value of 7. The maximum volume fraction of calcite is also produced in a zone where the pH is between 9 and 10. Considering the healing phenomenon is rather fast, especially in CO 2 enriched water, we will only present lately modelling results where CSH degradation is not taken into account. Consideration of the influence of porosity on flow leads to a localisation of calcite production as il- lustrated in Figure 8 comparing calculated solid profiles after 15 days of immersion in CO 2 enriched water. In some cases, this phenomenon participates to the nullification of self-healing speed after some days due to porosity drop (until volume fraction close to zero) as illustrated in Figure 9 where the calcite thickness is calculated from the volume frac- tion and the cell thickness. Thus, the local porosity decrease can explain the end of the healing phe- nomenon while its slowdown is principally due to the diffusion controlled process of calcium leaching through the calcite layer and carbonated zone. Influence of curing conditions From the parameters studied to represent the effect of curing conditions on self-healing potential, the portlandite content around the concrete surface has the most significant effect. Calcite amount formed near the surface is lower than for the original speci- men. The maximum amount of calcite in the crack, i.e. self-healing potential is also affected (Figure 10). Therefore, the better the hydration at the con- crete surface, the higher the portlandite amount and self-healing potential. Figure 8: Calcite, portlandite and porosity volume frac- tions profiles after 15 days of immersion in CO 2 -enriched water (a) without taking into account the effect of poros- ity on flow, (b) taking into consideration the effect of porosity on flow. Negative depth corresponds to water. Concrete cover porosity has a smaller effect and mainly influences the localisation of the calcite formed. Calcite seems to precipitate preferentially in the higher porosity zone than in the water. Com- bined together, the lower portlandite quantity and higher porosity in the concrete cover lead to a signif- icantly reduced self-healing potential as observed in the experiments for C1 series. Influence of healing conditions Water flux into the crack decreases the amount of calcite formed in early hours, and even stop healing by dissolution of calcite after some days for a flux Figure 7: Surface topology of a healed specimen. Yellow and red colors denote that the healing product exits outside the crack. 177 Hilloulin et al. Figure 9: Influence of the porosity drop inside the mortar at 0.5mm depth on the healing process, e.g. calcite content in the water in contact with the mortar. of 30 µm/s compared to a flux of 0.3 µm/s, as illustrated in Figure 11. Thus, although this model does not deal with the mechanical resistance of the healing product against the water flux and does not takes into consideration some seeding effects likely responsible for the observed spatial variability, the model demonstrates that water flux can accelerate the dissolution of the healing product by water. This could be a reason of the observed relatively small healing ability of cracks exposed to water pressure in water pipes or reservoirs (Meichsner and Stelzner, 1989). Carbonate concentration in water increases the global speed of creation of calcium carbonate in the water or the concrete cover and also increases the self-healing potential. This result consists well with the experimental observation of a better self- healing potential when mortars are immersed in water with a higher carbonate ions content. How- ever, it appears in the model that, for lower carbon- ate concentrations, calcite is preferentially formed in the water rather than in the mortar. Then, the correlation between numerical self-healing poten- tial and experimental healing capacity might be calculated averaging the numerical results around the first cells of water in contact with the mortar and the first cells of the mortar. V. Conclusions and perspectives In this study, kinetics and potential of self-healing were studied. Experimentally, it has been shown that initial curing conditions have an important im- pact on the self-healing kinetics and potential. A new method consisting of immersing mortar speci- mens in CO 2 enriched water was proposed to heal cracks that cannot heal in tap water, which could be useful to quickly heal cracks of structures cured in low humidity environments. A reactive transport model was developed to simulate autogenic healing by calcium carbonate precipitation, with the aim to explain the influence of self-healing conditions and qualify the self-healing potential. Experimental observations have thus been explained, e.g. stop of the phenomenon due to porosity decrease and re-dissolution of healing product due to water flow into the crack, putting self-healing phenomenon at a cross-road between carbonation, leaching and hydration studies. Although these first results seem promising, more research is needed to experimen- Figure 10: Evolution of the calcite thickness formed in the crack for the two initial portlandite contents. 178 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 11: Influence of the water flux parallel to the crack on the calcite development. tally describe the self-healing product and the as- sociated concrete cover composition in order to input more representative material parameters in the model (porosity description, local hydration product quantities) because of the nature of the natural self-healing phenomenon, at the cross-road between leaching and carbonation. Moreover, it could be interesting to study the interest of wet-dry cycles on self- healing. Finally, the authors hope that, with the help of reactive transport models, easy environmental con- ditions for fast self-healing can be designed.

As product of this chemical reaction a swellable alkali-silica gel can exert pressure leading to cracking of the material. The damages induced by ASR can differ in their magnitude, and to assign certainly that ASR is the main damage mechanism a microscopic investigation is necessary. Therefore this article presents a study on concrete affected by ASR with the purpose of assessing the degree of damage and evaluating various alkali-sensitive aggregates. For texture analysis thin section petrography is the major tool. Optical microscopy offers the best way to analyse ASR-affected concrete samples for damage classification by visualising the gel and the crack formation. The chemical investigation of the gel enables a precise determination of the involved amounts of the major oxides SiO 2 , CaO, Na 2 O and K 2 O. The proportions of these components of the gel are decisive with regard to its ability to swell. For this analysis scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilised. Furthermore micro X-ray fluorescence analysis showed elemental distributions, especially the depletion or enrichment of elements involved in ASR. Keywords: alkali-silica reaction; concrete; damage analysis; materials characterisation; preparation of thin sections I. Introduction Concrete is the most applied building material in modern times. It is present in all kinds of struc- tures and no other material seems to replace con- crete as the most selected building material in the near future. The prime advantages are the high performance, the easy production and a facile pro- cessability. The sustainability and durability are important requirements to concrete. Even if con- crete is significantly less susceptible against factors promoting a damage, compared to other materials, there are still mechanisms affecting it. In particular, high-ways and hydraulic structures made of con- crete worldwide show cases of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) damages. This article refers to experience at BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing for sev- eral decades to ASR research and damage assess- ment. ASR is a severe damage mechanism that can occur in concrete, when certain conditions related to composition and exposition arise in a critical combination. The chemical reaction is based on the alkalis and the silica in the concrete and was first identified by Stanton in highway structures in California (Stan- ton, 1940). Actually three components are needed to initiate ASR: alkali-sensitive siliceous aggregates, alkalis coming from internal (cement or other com- ponents) or external sources (de-icing salt or sea water) and water. If all of these components are suf- ficiently present an alkali-silica gel could be formed (Hobbs, 1988). This gel itself needs additional space when it is formed. Furthermore it is able to swell in the presence of humidity, both processes gener- ating an expansion pressure inside the concrete. As a consequence of intensive expansion, cracks can occur, which significantly lowers the strength of the material. Parameters like amount and chemical composition of the gel as well as the pattern and width of cracks can help to classify the ASR damage (Swamy, 1992). The objective of this article is to demonstrate the microscopic work on ASR affected concrete sam- ples, carried out to assess the damaging process or to evaluate various alkali-sensitive aggregates. It will explain the approach of ASR investigation from the macroscale to microscale, starting briefly with the condition assessment, over treatment and investigations of samples in the laboratory, to the use of different microscopical and analytical tech- niques. In the main part the characteristic features for identifying ASR in concrete are presented by using microscopic images. Especially the emphasis lies on the role of the aggregate. Different kinds of aggregates and varying damage patterns are shown and explained. The formation and resulting char- acteristics of the gel are discussed more detailed. 183 Werner et al. Figure 1: ASR affected concrete construction showing extensive cracks and the escape of the alkali-silica gel. As the gel reacts with the atmosphere, a characteristic white carbonated efflorescence remains on the surface of the construction. Especially the amount and properties of the gel are known to deliver important information relating to the damage process. Ongoing research is aimed to reveal interrelationships between the chemical composition of the gels and its damaging potential. Examples for these investigations, carried out with scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) spectroscopy and mi- cro X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF), are presented in the last chapter. II. Methodology A common investigation due to ASR begins with a broad assessment of the affected structure and ends with a specific sample being studied micro- scopically at high magnification. Structures suffer- ing from ASR damages typically show extensive macroscale cracks, even on the surface. An escape of the alkali-silica gel out of the material is typical, but it reacts quickly with the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This causes a carbonated efflo- rescence, which deposits as a characteristic white pattern on the surface of the concrete (Figure 1). In addition, expansion of single aggregates located near the surface can result in pop-outs, which rep- resent conical fragments leaving a sinkhole in the concrete. The distinct presence of cracks at the surface sim- plifies the consideration, where to take samples out of the concrete construction for further laboratory tests. If an estimation of the risk for the further damage development is needed, the storage of con- crete samples under ASR provoking conditions (e.g. slightly elevated temperature, increased alkali and water supply) for a specific time is a frequently 184 used tool (Chatterji, 2005). All these accelerated ASR tests are conceptualised to evaluate mainly the ASR sensitivity of aggregates for classification before using it in concrete production. As a re- sult of ongoing ASR, the concrete sample expands, which is observed by measuring length changes. The length change is used to classify if the sample is either sensitive due to ASR or not. Examples for often used tests are the accelerated mortar bar method ASTM C 1260 or the concrete prism test ASTM C 1293. In Germany a special guideline for the classification of aggregates related to ASR by the ’German Committee for Reinforced Concrete’ specifies the slightly modified way of testing (DAf- Stb, 2013). The following detailed description of ASR in this article is based on microscopic work. For this pur- pose the combination of optical microscopy and SEM/EDX offers a comprehensive method to ac- quire the following essential information. Three major aspects can be taken into consideration. First of all the petrographic analysis offers the best way to describe the present aggregates and moreover to classify the ASR sensitivity of these aggregates. The second focus lies on the visualisation of cracks and the alkali-silica gel, even for microscale formations. Finally the quantification of the chemical compo- sition can be obtained by measuring the gel. All aspects together contain important information for the precise identification of ASR and a potential risk for further damage. To gain representative results, a special thin sec- tion preparation is necessary. Normally ASR dam- aged samples show a weak cohesion. Therefore the preparation process is based on the solidification of the sample by using a specific resin. In addition 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 2: ASR damaged concrete of a hydraulic structure. a) Macroscopic overview of a thin section in which the opal in the centre shows strong ASR induced cracks spreading in different directions through the hardened cement paste and the aggregates. b) Enlarged PPL-Image of the same sample showing massive alkali-silica gel accumulating in a pore. c) Enlarged PPL-Image of the same sample showing alkali-silica gel filled cracks spreading from the big aggregate at the right side into the hardened cement paste and through other aggregates. this prevents the sample from further deteriora- tion during the preparation steps. After drying at moderate temperatures and a vacuum-pressure im- pregnation the resin penetrates the whole sample and after curing it obtains the sample material in a fixed state. In this way the alkali-silica gel, which is very sensitive to leaching and drying, is conserved in the resin with as small as possible alteration. A fluorescent coloured pigment is added to the resin, which offers a unique way to discern those finer resin-filled areas in detail by its colour and by irra- diating with UV light. In consequence of the size of the aggregates of the concrete, special dimen- sioned thin sections in the order of 60 x 90 mm are commonly produced to include a sufficiently large area to analyse. Water is an involved factor of ASR. The whole preparation process has to be carried out completely anhydrous. The replacement of water with petroleum prevents changes of the reaction products and the leaching of the gel. For this pub- lication optical microscopic images were acquired by using the polarising microscope Zeiss Axioskop 40 and the stereo microscope Olympus SZX16 both using transmitted illumination in plane-polarised light (PPL) and cross-polarised light (XPL). In addi- tion, both microscopes are equipped with UV light. The chemical composition of the gel can be deter- mined by using the SEM Leo Gemini 1530 VP and the µ-XRF EDAX Eagle III. Those allow fast simulta- neous EDX-multi-elemental analysis for mappings and point analysis. III. Asr induced damage in concrete The presence of an alkali-silica gel is not always resulting in a deterioration of the concrete. Basi- cally it is decisive how much sensitive aggregate is contained in the concrete and how it is distributed. Furthermore, the reactivity of the used aggregates is important and how much gel can possibly be formed. The concrete could also offer enough pores for the gel to spread out. This will inhibit or delay an expansion pressure leading to cracking. The chemical composition can vary leading to the gen- eration of swellable or non-swellable gels. How- ever, with the incorporation of water by the gel it increases the probability of expansion and will likely damage the concrete microstructure. The ab- sorption of water is reversible, which results in a recurring mechanism of wetting and drying. In- deed the absence of gel cannot exclude ASR as the main trigger for the damage. For example precip- 185 Werner et al. Figure 3: PPL-images of different ASR affected aggregates: a) Microcrystalline quartz shows a uniform reaction rim due to dissolution of the silica at the whole surface. b) Gneiss shows crack progression following the boundaries of the distorted quartz minerals. itations could leach out all of the damaging gel remaining just the unfilled cracks in the building material. Therefore the microscale view is even more important to possibly see a few tiny remnants of the alkali-silica gel. The main ASR induced damages in concrete are attributed to cracks eminating from aggregates. These can occur through all components of the concrete, through the hardened cement paste or through the aggregates as well as along the inter- face of them. Those typical patterns are mainly influenced by the mineralogy of the aggregates. It can take many years until the ASR damages can be observed on a concrete construction (Blight and Alexander, 2011). Structures close to sea are sub- jected to additional alkali ingress of the salt water. Also de-icing salts used for highways supply al- kalis to the concrete. An ASR damaged sample of a hydraulic structure is indicated in Figure 2a. This macroscopic overview of a thin section shows the widespread deterioration due to cracks, but the alkali-silica gel is not clear identifiable. To certify that ASR is the trigger of the cracks, an enlarged microscopic view is necessary. Figure 2b and Fig- ure 2c refer to the gel accumulation inside pores and cracks by using optical microscopy. Role of the aggregate In all cases the ASR damage depends on the pres- ence of alkali-sensitive siliceous aggregates, which is in turn connected to the mineralogical structure of the aggregate. The crystallinity of an aggregate is of essential importance (Dron and Brivot, 1992). ASR on highly crystalline aggregates made primar- ily of silica just takes place at the exterior surface of the aggregate. This process is slow and dissolves little amounts of silicate ions. Therefore those aggre- gates (e.g. quartz) are approximately inert (Broek- mans, 2004). In comparison to that, amorphous or poorly crystalline forms of silica (e.g. opal or glass) are prone to attack by hydroxyl and alkali ions into its interior (Dent Glasser and Kataoka, 1981). Espe- cially for porous aggregates the hydroxyl ions can penetrate easily, which increases the ASR intensity compared to denser aggregates. In general aggre- gates consisting of micro and crypto crystalline quartz varieties afford more surfaces for ASR and hence show higher sensitivity. Besides different mineralogical structures, var- Figure 4: PPL-images of the cracking patterns of different aggregates: a) Aggregates, containing fine grained quartz, show cracks through the whole particle due to ASR. b) Siliceous rock shows an ASR induced crack penetrating straight through the highly crystalline quartz veins. 186 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 5: Microscopic images of a completely with alkali-silica gel filled pore. Amorphous and crystalline parts are visible. a) PPL-image. b) XPL-image. ious aggregates differ in the appearance of their damages (Ferraris, 1995). The dissolution and crack initiating of an aggregate depends on the position of the most weak silica parts. For an aggregate built up just by amorphous SiO 2 the entire particle can dissolve and will show a uniform reaction zone on the whole surface (Figure 3a). In comparison to that a polymineral aggregate (e.g. granite or greywacke) can consist of pure silica (mainly quartz) with dif- fering crystal structures and other minerals like mica, feldspar or pyroxene. This specifies the path of cracks inside polymineral aggregates along the most sensitive silica phases. As indicated in Fig- ure 3b, one gneiss aggregate, containing thoroughly distorted quartz due to tectonic distortions (often called stress quartz), shows a crack accumulating and branching out at these areas. Aggregates con- sisting of fine grained quartz (e.g. flint or chert) typically show a uniform texture of interlocking grains. These kinds of aggregates show single and almost linear cracks (Figure 4a). Siliceous rocks, as shown in Figure 4b, may contain a lot of different sized and oriented quartz veins. In this example the ASR induced crack penetrates the aggregate regardless of the orientation of those veins. That is because the quartz veins represent no distorted silica phases and thus don’t affect the propagation of the crack. Texture characteristics of the alkali-silica gel Under PPL the amorphous alkali-silica gel appears mainly transparent (white) and often shows a char- acteristic mud-cracked structure because of shrink- age effects due to desiccation (Figure 5a). This could either originate during the life time of the concrete construction or caused from the sample preparation. The gel is isotropic, showing full ex- tinction under XPL (Figure 5b). Usually it fills out the available space, already existing cracks and the pores. When there is no further space for the gel to spread out, a pressure on the surrounding material is applied and with increasing pressure cracking will probably be enhanced. Hence the air pore con- tent in concrete is an important parameter, as it Figure 6: a) PPL-image of an ASR induced crack through a quartzitic rock fragment showing alkali-silica gel accumulation at the endings of the crack. b) PPL-image of another quartzitic aggregate showing alkali-silica gel deposition completely along the crack walls. 187 Werner et al. Table 1: General chemical composition of alkali-silica gels and certain ratios to develop a swelling pressure in wt%. General composition(Helmuth et al., 1992) Necessary composition for swelling(Kawamura and Iwahori, 2004) Necessary composition for swelling(Mansfeld, 2008) SiO 2 40 - 83 CaO 1 - 48 Na 2 O 0 - 23 Both alkalis not more than 25 K 2 O 0 - 24 5 - 30 offers more space for the gel. The alkali-silica gel in cracks or air voids is not al- ways a pure gel, since crystallisation can take place. Areas of much gel often show a mix of amorphous and crystalline parts, where typical interference colours from white to brownish can be visualised using XPL (Figure 5b). As already mentioned, ASR induced cracks can be filled entirely (Fig 2c) or only partially with gel or even no gel can be present. In Figure 6 two quartzitic rock grains show different gel accumula- tions. In the first case (Figure 6a) it is accumulated just at both ends of the crack and in between it is unfilled. This remaining ’unfilled’ area is filled just with the blue resin based on the sample prepa- ration. The other example (Figure 6b) shows an aggregate in which the walls of the crack are con- sistently filled with gel. The narrow unfilled range is probably a result due the drying by the sample preparation process. rameters (e.g. source of alkalis, aggregates and water), the sensitive aggregate for the gel formation and the age of the gel. The proportion of these ingredients affect the physical parameters (e.g. the viscosity) and of course the microstructure. The amount of alkalis and calcium is prior responsible for the swelling capacity and thus for the potential damage (Tab. 1). Above an alkali content of 25 wt% no great expansions are expected (Kawamura and Iwahori, 2004). Additionally when the gel is high in calcium no swelling occurs (Ferraris, 1995). To evoke the swelling ability, the amount of CaO has to be between 5 and 30 wt% (Mansfeld, 2008). Without CaO no swelling pressure will be build-up and too much CaO results in the formation of non swellable C-S-H phases. For a comprehensive investigation of ASR af- fected structures the analysis of the chemical com- position of the reaction products is advisable to affirm if alkali-silica gel is present. IV. The chemistry of alkali-silica gel Analysing alkali-silica gel via SEM/EDX The alkali-silica gel mainly consists of SiO 2 , CaO, Na 2 O, K 2 O and H 2 O. The amounts of all of these oxides can considerably vary, as indicated in Ta- ble 1. This depends primarily on the initial pa- SEM/EDX is the commonly used tool to detect the quantitative chemical composition of an alkali- silica gel. Two samples were chosen for the SEM- investigation, which are shown by PPL- and XPL- Figure 7: Amplified views of the two quartzitic aggregates as indicated in Figure 6 using PPL (a, c) and XPL (b, d) 188 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 8: a) BSE-image of the same quartzitic rock grain showing in Figure 7 (left). b) BSE image of the highlighted area showing the position of EDX-analysis. c) EDX result of the chemical composition of the measurement spot. d) - f) Same procedure using the quartzitic aggregate of Figure 7 (right) with focus on the layered structure of the alkali-silica gel. images in Figure 7. In these figures the presence of amorphous and crystalline reaction products are both clearly visible. Figure 7 (left) shows a crack perpendicular to the contact zone between the aggregate and the hard- ened cement paste. Remarkably just the area close to the contact zone contains gel, which reveals with higher magnification a typical mud-cracked struc- ture. Obviously this very small reaction zone and low amounts of gel was sufficient to form the whole crack. This can be explained by the dense structure of the quartzitic grain. Figure 7 (right) shows an ASR affected crack inside another quartzitic rock grain. The gel in this example fills the entire crack and shows a characteristic layered structure with mud-cracks and a brownish colour. In both cases gel is present next to crystalline reaction products. By using SEM the Back-Scattered-Electron (BSE) images contain information about the distribution of different elements in the sample (Figure 8). Upon a higher magnification the gel gets even better vi- sualised (Figure 8b and 8e) and offers a very good Figure 9: a) PPL-image of an ASR damaged opal sandstone. b) µ-XRF acquired RGB-image showing the element distribution of potassium (red), calcium (green) and silicon (blue). 189 Werner et al. setting of the measurement points (spotsize of 5 µm resp. 2 µm). The results of the EDX analysis are shown in Figure 8c and 8f. In both cases the EDX-spectra show a characteristic alkali-silica gel pattern with high silicon, calcium and potassium peaks. Minor amounts of sodium are present in both EDX-spectra. The carbon content in both sam- ples is attributed to the resin used for the sample preparation. Analysing alkali-silica gel with µ-XRF The use of µ-XRF offers another opportunity to gain the chemical composition of ASR affected structures and identifying the alkali-silica gel. Besides mea- suring single spots, the elemental mapping of a specific surface area is a very useful tool to anal- yse for instance an entire aggregate. An elemental mapping of an ASR affected region can offer infor- mation about chemical changes in the vicinity of the alkali-silica gel formation, e.g. a depletion of calcium inside the hardened cement paste or silicon inside the aggregate as well as an enrichment of alkalis inside the crack. One ASR affected sample is shown in Figure 9. The aggregate shows heavy damages with several cracks (Figure 9a). The µ-XRF-image, indicated in Figure 9b, illustrates the elemental distribution of this area (spotsize of 50 µm). By overlaying of three elements RGB-images can be acquired, showing potassium in red, calcium in green and silicon in blue. This exemplifies the depletion or enrichment of these three elements in detail. The concrete in Figure 9 shows cracks with distinct potassium en- richments at the contact zone between aggregate and hardened cement paste. Especially at the crack walls potassium accumulations are visible. The fur- ther inside of the aggregate, the cracks contain less of the alkali-silica gel, which is explicable with the presence of the blue resin caused by the sample preparation indicated in Figure 9a. V. Conclusion and perspectives This article shows that the combination of different microscopic devices offers a suitable methodology to evaluate the material properties and to deter- mine the damage potential due to ASR. In the last decades a huge number of studies were published worldwide concerning ASR, but there are still ques- tions e.g. about the exact reaction mechanism and related to testing the ASR damaging potential of aggregates and also concrete in the most reliable and fast way. The division ’Building Materials’ of the BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing carries on intensive work with ASR. In many cases materials from potentially ASR affected buildings 190 are examined and evaluated. Beyond that ongoing ASR research work is reflected to different aspects. One finished PhD thesis considered the natural pozzolana ’Rhenish trass’ and its effect on ASR in concrete (Bürgisser, 2011). Additional topics among others are the sampling and laboratory investiga- tions of motorway sections with different ASR dam- age classes, the effect of hydrophobizing of concrete surfaces to reduce the ASR damage. Furthermore the range of topics includes investigations of ASR in structural concrete elements under simultaneous dynamical loading and external alkali supply. The PhD project of the main author of this arti- cle is focused on the grain size dependence of the damaging ASR potential. The aim is to study the re- lationship between the aggregate properties (grain sizes and geometry) of different aggregate types and the ASR mechanism based on mineralogical and microstructural characterisation of the reaction products. In particular, differences of the amount and the chemical composition of the reaction prod- ucts, based on the chosen grain geometry, are the major concern.

Šachlová ⇤ , A. Kuchařová, Z. Pertold, R. P řikryl Institute of Geochemistry, Mineralogy and Mineral Resources, Fac. of Science, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic ⇤ s.sachlova@seznam.cz Abstract Various quartz-rich aggregates (pegmatite quartz, quartzite, quartz meta-greywacke, and chert) were subjected to an accelerated mortar bar test (AMBT, following the ASTM C1260 standard) and a chemical test (CT, following the ASTM C289 standard) with the aim to evaluate their potential for the alkali-silica reaction (ASR). After testing, the accelerated mortar bars (AMBs) were analysed by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). Only two samples (quartz metagreywacke, and pegmatite quartz) were evaluated as being deleterious, according to the standard classification of the CT; the other aggregates were classified as innocuous. The AMBT indicated different results. Quartz metagreywacke, chert, and quartzite exceeded the 0.1% expansion limit after the 14-day test period. Only pegmatite quartz indicated a lower value. SEM-EDS analysis of the AMBs confirmed the presence of alkali-silica gels (ASGs) and ASR-microcracks. The most extensive deterioration was found in those AMBs containing chert and quartz metagreywacke aggregates, in which the microcracks formed an extensive network. Massive deposits of ASG were found as filling of pore voids, microcracks, and aggregate/cement paste boundaries. The high ASR potential of chert and quartz metagreywacke was attributed to the small grain size and the poor crystallinity. ASR microcracks, with no connection to grain boundaries, were the most common feature observed in both quartzite and pegmatite quartz. These microcracks and microholes, without connection to the grain boundaries, were several mum long, generally randomly oriented. Microscopic examination confirmed the high (resp. middle) ASR potential of quartz metagreywacke and chert (resp. quartzite) well correlating with expansion values of the AMBs. Only the pegmatite quartz seemed to be safe from ASR. No correlation was found with the results of CT, which under-evaluated the ASR potential of two of the aggregates investigated. Keywords: alkali-silica reaction, accelerated mortar bar test, electron microscopy I. Introduction Petrographic examination of aggregate source rocks by microscopic techniques, in combination with the accelerated mortar bar test (AMBT) and/or con- crete prism test (CPT), are the most widely used methods to assess the potential of aggregates to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) (e.g., Lindgård et al., 2010). Such a methodical approach enables quan- tification of the ASR potential of aggregates, based on the expansion values of accelerated mortar bars (AMBs) (resp. concrete prisms); also to identify deleterious components of the aggregates, based on their mineral composition and microstructure (e.g., Hewlett, 2003). Another group of methods is based on the leaching of a specific grain size fraction of aggregates in alkaline solution, and on the analy- sis of the amount of Si 4 + leached into the alkaline solution combined with the reduction of alkalinity of the solution (e.g., chemical test, CT, following the ASTM C289 standard). The main advantage of the CT is regarded to be: the short test period, low demand for laboratory equipment, resultant low cost of the method, and almost no influence of the technician. Although some inaccuracies of CT have been pointed out in recent studies (e.g., Rolim et al., 2012), CT has been successfully used as a method to indicate the amount of SiO 2 soluble in alkaline solutions (e.g., Hünger et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013) In the Czech Republic, the standard method for ASR testing of aggregates (TP 137) requires all three method types: petrographic analysis of aggregates, AMBT (modified according to the ASTM C1260 standard), CPT (modified according to the RILEM AAR2 standard), and CT (modified according to the ASTM C289 standard). Recent research has pointed out some inaccuracies of the CT when CT was applied on volcanic rocks (Št’astná et al., 2013). Five of seventeen investigated volcanic and/or vol- canosedimentary rocks were classified as innocu- ous, although they exhibited AMBs expansion val- ues higher than 0.1% after 14 days. It was con- cluded that the CT results were affected by weath- ering and alteration, affecting the mineral compo- 191 Šachlová et al. Figure 1: Classification of aggregates according to the CT.

The limits between aggregates considered deleterious, potentially deleterious, and innocuous were adopted from the ASTM C289 standard (indicated by the grey dashed line). sition of the aggregates (Št’astná et al., 2013). The weathering caused increasing amounts of clay min- erals, which increased reduction of the alkalinity (e.g., Wakizaka, 2000). The current paper has as its aim to evaluate the ASR potential of aggregates, em- ploying all the methods required by TP 137 (2003). The testing was performed on quartz-rich aggre- gates exhibiting almost no signs of weathering or alteration. With the aim to visualize and document the origin of ASR, the standard AMBT was fulfilled by microscopic analysis of AMBs after 1, 5, 9, and 14 days of testing. II. Aggregates An experimental study was performed using a set of quartz-rich rocks exhibiting different microstruc- tural and quartz deformation characteristics (Table 1). Two of the selected aggregates (quartzite and quartz metagreywacke) have been used in the con- struction industry as fillers for both concrete and asphalt mixtures as well as in gravel basements (Ka- menolomy ČR s.r.o., 2013, Persson, personal com- munication). Another two samples were sampled from a natural outcrop (chert) and in a quarry aban- doned (pegmatite quartz, Lännstyrelssen, Väster- norrland, 2015). From each of the samples, pieces ranging from several cm to several dm were sam- Figure 2: Expansion curves of AMBs.

III. Experimental methods CT A CT was performed, following the ASTM C289 standard (2007). Prior to performance of the test, each of the samples were crushed to obtain an ag- gregate of the desired granulometry. The aggre- gates (25 g of each) were stored in Teflon bottles. After adding 25 ml of 1M NaOH, the bottles were tempered at 80 C for 24 hours. After rapid cooling, the solution was separated. The reduction of alka- linity was analyzed based on the titration procedure described in the standard. The amount of Si 4 + dissolved into the solu- chert 35 d 0.01 / 0.53 tion was analyzed employing the ICP-OES method in the Laboratories of the Geological Institute (Charles University in Prague, O. Šebek opera- tor). A ThermoScientific iCAP 6500 radially-viewed, inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spec- trometer (ICP OES, ThermoScientific, Cambridge, UK) equipped with an ASX-520 auto sampler was used for Si concentration measurements, using the instrument parameters recommended by the man- ufacturer. The ICP OES instrument was calibrated using external calibration standard solutions. The calibration standard solutions used in this study were diluted from commercial stock solutions (1000 mg · L 1 , Analytika Praha, Czech Republic). Matrix matched calibration was used for solution analy- sis. The analytical protocol consisted of analysis of an instrumental blank (2% (v/v) HNO 3 ), a cal- 193 Šachlová et al. ibration solution, a procedural blank, samples, a calibration check, and a quality control solution (Certipur R , Merck, Germany; and Aristar R and BDH Laboratory Supplies, UK) diluted to a concen- tration of 5 mg L 1 . The differences between the calibration and control solutions did not exceed 5% relative. All the calibration and control solutions were freshly prepared before the measurements, and all the samples were measured immediately. AMBT An AMBT was performed, following the ASTM C1260-07 standard (2007). Prior to performance of the AMBT, each of the sampled materials were crushed to obtain an aggregate of the desired gran- ulometry. The mortar was then mixed using aggre- gate (0.125/5 mm fraction), CEM I 42.5 R cement, and distilled water in the ratio of 2.25/1/0.47 (ag- gregate/cement/water). Four different AMBs were prepared from each sample. After 24 hours of hard- ening, plus 24 hours of tempering, the AMBs were placed in 1M NaOH solution at 80 C. Expansion of the AMBs were measured on 3 AMBs for fourteen days through the test period. Every 1 st , 5 th , 9 th , and 14 th day of the testing, 1/4 of one AMB from each sample was cut and used for the preparation of polished sections. Scanning electron microscopy combined with en- ergy dispersive spectrometer The polished sections (25 ⇥ 25 ⇥ 4 mm) were pre- pared from AMBs after 1, 5, 9, and 14 days of AMBT, and then subjected to microscopic analy- sis employing a scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS, con- ducted at the Laboratory of Electron Microscopy and Microanalysis, Charles University in Prague, M. Racek operator). The AMB sections were coated in a carbon atmosphere. The measurements were performed on a Tescan Vega instrument with an energy-dispersive analytical system (Oxford Instru- ments LINK ISIS 300) under the following condi- tions: 0.8 nA (for BSE, EDS); 120 s counting time; and accelerating voltage of 15 kV. For the standard quantitative calibration, a 53 Mineral Standard Set #02753-AB (SPI Supplies) was used. IV. Results CT Standard classification (according to ASTM C289) indicated two deleterious aggregates (pegmatite quartz, and quartz metagreywacke) and two innocu- ous aggregates (quartzite, and chert). Both values (reduction in alkalinity, and dissolved silica) of the chert sample were found very close to the borders 194 between the area of the innocuous aggregates (resp. deleterious, and potentially deleterious) (Figure 1). Surprising results were found when comparing the values of dissolved silica, which increased in the fol- lowing order: quartzite < chert < pegmatite quartz < quartz metagreywacke. AMBT ASR potential, according to the AMBT (ASTM C1260), is designed for rapid assessments between non-reactive (aggregates indicating < 0.100% expan- sion of AMBs) and reactive (aggregates indicating > 0.100% expansion of AMBs) types of aggregates. Three of the investigated aggregates exceeded the limit of 0.100% after the fourteen day test period (quartzite, quartz metagreywacke, and chert). Only one aggregate (pegmatite quartz) indicated a lower value (Figure 2). Microscopic analysis of AMBs AMBs were subjected to microscopic analysis (em- ploying SEM/EDS) after 1, 5, 9, and 14 days of testing. The analysis confirmed a microstructure typical for mortar specimens containing crushed aggregates. Aggregates (mostly sharp edged) were covered by cement paste. Pore voids (typically cir- cular, with a 1.5 mm maximum diameter) were ran- domly distributed throughout the AMB. Variable lengths of the immersion in 1M NaOH were mainly observed in the microstructure of the cement paste and on the extension of ASR products. ASR was documented according to the network of microcracks penetrating the aggregates (Figure 3a), cement paste, aggregate/cement paste bound- aries (Figure 3b), and according to the alkali-silica gels (ASGs, Table 2). Microcracks in the cement paste, pore voids, and aggregate boundaries were 50 mm wide, maximum. Microcracks penetrat- ing aggregates varied in their lengths and widths, mostly corresponding to the type of aggregate. ASGs accumulated in the pore voids and micro- cracks (Figure 3c). V. Discussion Time dependence of ASR The initial stages of ASR were observed accord- ing to the shape of the expansion curves after 1-2 days in AMB containing chert and quartz meta- greywacke, and after 5-6 days in AMB contain- ing quartzite and pegmatite quartz. This obser- vation had a close correspondence to the results of the microscopic analysis of AMB. After 1 day, ASGs accumulated only in pore voids (Figure 4d). Their presence in microcracks were rare. Microc- racks penetrated mainly the cement paste and ag- 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Table 2: Selected EDS analysis of ASGs (in wt. %).

Several microcracks penetrated aggregates. This initial stage of ASR was observed, preferentially, in AMB containing chert and quartz metagreywacke. After 5 days of immersion in alkaline solution, AMB containing chert and quartz metagreywacke already exhibited extensive accumulations of ASGs, as well as the dissolution of areas rich in cryptocrys- talline and amorphous SiO 2 (Figure 4a, 4h). On the contrary, AMB containing quartzite and pegmatite quartz still only exhibited the initial stage of ASR (Figure 4b; microcracks penetrating cement paste and aggregate/cement paste boundaries, rare accu- mulations of ASGs). After 14 days, if the immersion was in alkaline solution, the most extensive network of microcracks was found in AMBs containing chert and quartz metagreywacke aggregates (Figure 4f, 4i) propagat- ing through cement paste, aggregates, and pore voids. The microcracks followed grain-to-grain boundaries on the aggregate particles. Parts of the aggregates were completely leached out, typically in matrix-rich areas.

Less extensive deterioration was observed in quartzite (Figure 3b). ASR microcracks penetrating aggregates were rare. Microcracks and microholes (several µm long, and generally randomly oriented) were observed penetrating aggregate particles un- connected to grain boundaries. ASGs (mixed with cement paste) mostly filled pore voids (Figure 4c). Factors affecting ASR potential of aggregates The investigated samples exhibited different ASR potentials. The highest ASR potential was indicated by those aggregates containing a cryptocrystalline matrix in significant volumes (25-65 vol.%, Figure 5b, 5c). The dissolution of the matrix originated on grain boundaries, propagating through the entire volume of the matrix. In contrast, parts of a chert and metagreywacke sample, composed mainly of well-crystallized quartz (up to 200 µm), exhibited ASR mostly located along the grain boundaries. The high ASR potential of chert and quartz meta- Figure 3: ASR microcracks penetrating aggregates (part a), aggregate / cement paste boundaries (parts a-c), ASGs (ASG) filling microcracks and pore voids (part c), and SiO 2 dissolution (part c).

Variable ASR potential of quartzite and pegmatite quartz was attributed to quartz deformation and recrystallization (Figure 5a, 5d). Undulose extinc- tion and formation of quartz subgrains indicated increased dislocation density in the quartz crystal lattice, which can increase its ASR potential (e.g., Wigum, 1995; Wenk et al., 2008; Locatti et al., 2010). The role of K-feldspar and plagioclase was more complicated, forming up to 28 vol.% of one of the aggregates tested. The possible dissolution of al- kalis from the feldspars, and their possible role in ASR, has been discussed previously (e.g., Lu et al., 2006). Almost no ASR was observed in AMBs con- taining pegmatite quartz. ASGs were only found in a small portion of pore voids (Figure 4c) and microcracks. ASR microcracks propagated mostly along aggregate particle boundaries (Figure 4b, 4c). 196 VI. Conclusion Quartz-rich aggregates were tested for their poten- tial to ASR employing AMBT, CT, and based on petrographic analysis of the aggregates. Addition- ally, AMBs were subjected to microscopic analysis with the aim to visualize the ASR products. The CT results indicated quartzite and chert sam- ple to be innocuous; and pegmatite quartz and quartz metagreywacke to be deleterious, due to ASR. On the contrary, AMBT results indicated quartzite, chert, and quartz metagreywacke to be deleterious (exceeding the limit of 0.100% after four- teen days); and only pegmatite quartz to be non- reactive. Microscopic analysis of AMB showed the initial stage of ASR in all AMB after 1-5 days of immersion in alkaline solution. After 14 days of immersion, the degree of ASR increased rapidly in AMB containing quartz metagreywacke and chert. The ASR produced an extensive network of microc- racks penetrating cement paste, aggregates, and ag- 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 5: Microfabric of the quartz-rich rocks studied: quartzite (sample No. Q0B, a); chert (sample No. Q3, b); quartz meta-greywacke (sample No. Q7C, c); pegmatite quartz (sample No. Q9A, d), as seen in a polarizing microscopy (crossed nicols). gregate/cement paste boundaries. Extensive signs of SiO 2 dissolution were found in chert and meta- greywacke particles, mainly composed of a cryp- tocrystalline matrix. Poor crystallinity and very small grain size facilitated dissolution of these ar- eas. Less extensive (resp. almost no) deterioration in AMB had contained quartzite (resp. pegmatite quartz). ASR microcracks propagated along aggre- gate/cement paste boundaries. Aggregate particles penetrated by microcracks were rare in these AMB, comparing to those containing chert and quartz metagreywacke. Petrographic analysis of the aggregates con- firmed cryptocrystalline quartz in significant amounts in chert and quartz metagreywacke, which was well correlating with their high ASR poten- tial. The quartzite sample indicated the presence of strained quartz; typically with undulose extinc- tion and the origin of quartz subgrains, indicat- ing deformation and recrystallization under middle temperature regimes, which can increase the ASR potential of the aggregate comparing to the non- deformed quartz. Significant contents of K-feldspar and plagioclase probably released alkalis and in- creased the ASR potential of the aggregates. The low (but detectable) ASR potential of pegmatite quartz was explained by weak undulose extinction and the origin of quartz subgrains. The current study found a good correlation be- tween the AMBT results and the microscopic anal- ysis of AMB. On the other hand, no correlation was found between AMBT and CT. The CT under- evaluated the ASR potential of quartzite and chert; and over-evaluated the ASR potential of pegmatite quartz. The misleading results of the CT remained unexplained. For the follow-on study, it is proposed to correlate the results with a long term concrete prism test, with the aim to obtain results corre- sponding more closely with ASR origin in real con- crete.

Centro de Geologia da Universidade do Porto/DGAOT-FCUP . ⇤ saramedeiros@uac.pt Abstract The alkali silica reaction (ASR) has been found in several concrete structures in which volcanic rocks were used as aggregates. ASR caused by volcanic rocks has been studied in various countries among them Argentina, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand and Turkey. The reaction occurs between alkali (Na + and K + ) and hydroxyl (OH ) ions in the cement and certain reactive forms of silica in the aggregates. The reactivity of volcanic rocks is usually associated with the presence of Si-rich volcanic glass (SiO 2 >62-65%), altered minerals and the occurrence of some free silica forms. Santa Maria is an island located in the southern part of the Azores archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is formed by volcanic rocks of basic composition with intercalated sedimentary rocks. It is the oldest island of Azores with an age of 8.12 Ma. In order to characterize the reactivity of Azores volcanic aggregates a research project has been implemented through the ReAVA project (Characterization of Potential Reactivity of the Volcanic Aggregates from the Azores Archipelago: Implications on the Durability of Concrete Structures). This project comprises mainly the petrographic assessment of the aggregates and concrete petrography of some concrete core samples. In Santa Maria Island a program was carried out to produce thin sections from: (1) rock samples of two quarries of the island and (2) concrete core samples from the local airport pavement. One of the quarries was exploited for the local airport construction. Both rock samples showed significant alteration that was confirmed by the petrographic examination and by geochemical analyses. The concrete thin sections showed that the sand fraction is mostly composed of volcanic glass and that the cement paste has almost completely been replaced by a fibrous alkali-silica gel, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Keywords: concrete, volcanic aggregates, alkali-silica-reactions, Azores I. Introduction Concrete is a widely used building material. It can be applied in structures of different complex- ity. The aggregates represent the major component (about 3/4 in volume) playing an important role in the quality of concrete and consequently in its durability. The Azores archipelago (Figure 1) is located in the North Atlantic Ocean and consists of nine vol- canic Islands. The aggregates used in Azores are es- sentialy volcanic rocks of basic nature (e.g. basalts). Volcanic rocks have been used widely for concrete purposes in countries such as Argentina, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand and Turkey. In these countries several concrete structures appeared to be affected by ASR due to the use of volcanic rocks as aggre- gates. In Portugal, there is only one case reported regarding the performance of volcanic aggregates which is the study of the pavement of Santa Maria Island airport (Braga Reis et al., 1996). Santa Maria Island is the oldest island of the archipelago with an age of 8.12 Ma (Abdel-Monem, 1975). The study of Santa Maria Island aggregates is integrated in a research project called ReAVA (Char- acterization of Potential Reactivity of the Volcanic Aggregates from the Azores Archipelago: Impli- cations on the Durability of Concrete Structures). This project includes: (1) petrographic study of the aggregates, (2) assessment of their performance in laboratory expansion tests and (3) site inspection and core sampling of existing large structures in the Azores. This paper presents the results regarding the as- sessment of the potential reactivity of Santa Maria Island aggregates which included the petrography examination of the aggregates and of the concrete cores obtained from the pavement of the airport of Santa Maria Island. II. Materials The rock samples were collected from two quarries of Santa Maria Island. One of the quarries (Facho) 199 Medeiros et al. (2) petrographic examination. The geochemical analyses were made by the Act- labs Laboratory, in Canada. The major oxides were calculated according to the method of fusion- inductively coupled plasma (FUS-ICP: Thermo Jar- rell – Ash ENVIRO II ICP). The results were plotted on a TAS diagram to classify the rock samples. Figure 1: Azores archipelago. is the main source of aggregates of the island. This quarry is located inside a submarine eruptive centre which emitted basaltic lava flows and pyroclasts. The area of the quarry consists of: (1) a volcanic neck 150 m high, (2) several submarine lava flows with fractured and altered zones, and (3) interca- lated levels of reddish hialoclastites (Figure 2a). The other quarry (Brejo) is no longer active but in the mid 1940s it was heavily exploited for the construc- tion of the airport. The quarry consists of a thick wall of a subaerial basaltic lava flow (Figure 2b). The two quarries belong to the Facho-Pico Alto complex of Pliocene age. This complex is formed by submarine and subaerial lava flows. The rock sam- ples were named SMA-SM1 and SMA-SM2 for the first and second quarry, respectively. Four concrete cores were drilled in Santa Maria airport pavement in order to characterize the aggregates that were used in the concrete and to identify manifestations of ASR such as rims around the aggregate particles, cracks and possible products of ASR. III. Methods The methods used included: (1) geochemical analy- ses of both rocks (bulk rock chemical analysis) and To prepare thin-sections, billets of the rock hand samples and of concrete were cut and mounted with araldite on a standard sized carrier glass. The specimen were impregnated with epoxy resin to reinforce the sample material, seal off porosity and reduce preparation artefacts, then cured up to ⇠ 40 C until set. Thin-sections of 30µm thickness were lapped by hand using silicon carbide pow- der, and finally polished with 0.25 µm diamond grit. For the SEM/EDS analyses the thin-sections were sputter-coated with carbon under vacuum in a VG MICROTECH E6700/T800 instrument.The pet- rographic study of the rock and concrete samples was performed under an optical polarizing micro- scope Nikon Eclipse E 400 POL, both in plane po- larized light (PPL) and cross polarized light (XPL), with automatic camera AXION cam MRC. The mi- crophotographs were obtained by Axion Vision 3.1. software. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) FEI QUANTA 400 FEG ESEM/EDAX PAGASUS X4M equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was used to obtain images in backscattered electron detector (BSED) mode and to determine the qualitative composition of the reaction products. The operation conditions were 15 kV and collection time of 50 ses. Site inspection of the airport pavement was per- formed according to BCA (1992). Manifestations of deterioration were registered and sites marked for coring. The places selected were located on the runaway pavement where cracks were visible. The extracted cores were 100 mm in diameter and about 400 mm in length, crossing all the pavement slab thickness.

IV. Results Aggregates The two rock samples were classified as basanites according to the TAS diagram. The bulk geochemi- cal analyses of both samples show a high value of loss on ignition (LOI = 2.15% SMA-SM1 and LOI = 3.15% SMA-SM2) which suggests there is alteration of these rocks. LOI is widely used as a measure of volatile content and alteration of rocks. Chemically the more highly altered basalts are characterized by relatively high LOI. The two basanites are very similar in mineral composition and in textural fea- tures. They are composed of phenocrysts of olivine, clinopyroxene and rarely plagioclase (Figure 3a and 3b). The matrix is formed mostly by pyroxenes, pla- gioclase and opaque minerals with much less of olivines. The olivines show: (1) thick iddingzitized rims, (2) sometimes appear with skeletal forms and (3) inclusions of spinel, oxides and some volcanic glass. The clinopyroxenes show mostly hourglass structures or zoning. In sample SMA-SM1 carbon- ate minerals and zeolites were identified. The car- bonate minerals are filling some of the cracks in the rock (Figure 3a) and the zeolites occur in the groundmass as irregular masses with very weak birefringence. The SEM/EDS analyses were merely qualitative. However, they allowed the detection of anhedral intergranular crystals in several areas of sample SMA-SM1 (Medeiros et al., 2012). The composition and the habit of the crystals suggested they might correspond to zeolites (Figure 4a and 4b). Concrete The concrete drilling was carried out only in places where the concrete showed the most pronounced cracking. A total of four concrete cores were taken in different places of the airport pavement, one in the middle of the runaway track and the other three on opposite sides of the runaway pavement. The cores that were sampled along to longer longitu- dinal crack showed a white deposit covering the crack walls when the concrete portions split. In these broken surfaces, also the coarser aggregates particles are coated by several white rims (Figure 5). The concrete petrography showed that the aggre- gates are crushed basalt. The sand fraction contains mostly olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase crystals and rock fragments in which volcanic glass is the main component. In thin-sections the volcanic glass ap- pears light-brown, yellowish or dark brown (Figure 6) in plane polarized light and always isotropic in cross polarized light. In some particles, there are clay minerals forming rims of short acicular yellow- Figure 4: Aggregate petrography: a) SEM (BSED) image of fibrous zeolite (15.0 mm working distance); b) EDS spectrum of the zeolite. 201 Medeiros et al. Figure 5: Concrete: a) core of 100 mm in diameter. It was drilled from the site where a long longitudinal crack was observed. The coarse aggregates were rimmed by a whitish material. The crack surface is also covered by a whitish powder; b) pavement of Santa Maria airport where the largest crack in the runaway pavement is shown. ish crystals, with very low birefringence, around and partially replacing the phenocrysts (Figure 7). The interfaces between the aggregate particles and the cement paste are frequently debonded. Others are lined with a fibrous colourless to brownish ma- terial with low interferences colours (grey to white) which might correspond also to zeolite. The crys- tals of this mineral develop perpendicular to the interfaces. In other interfaces, the cracks are filled with carbonate minerals (Figure 8). The SEM/EDS analysis indicated that the glass is composed mainly of Si and Al with low content in Ca, Mg, Na and K (Figure 9). In some locations volcanic glass is heavily altered to clay minerals forming yellow rims. Several microcracks were observed crossing either aggregates particles and the cement paste. The concrete petrography analysis under opti- cal microscope also allowed the characterization of the cement paste. It was verified that the cement paste has been replaced/recrystallized forming an agglomerate of fibrous minerals with radial texture (Figure 10). The crystals formed were very light- coloured to whitish in plane polarised light and almost isotropic under cross polarised light. Within the cement paste, also agglomerations of fibrous minerals were observed, presumably replac- ing particles of the sand fraction. Intense cracking is observed. The SEM/EDS analysis of the cement paste indicated a composition of mainly Si with much lower contents of Al, Ca, Na and residual Mg (Figure 11a and 11b), quite different from the characteristic composition of a cement paste. Some of the cracks, specially the ones that cross the ag- gregate particles, were also filled with the acicular crystals, as described above. The habit and the qualitative composition obtained by SEM/EDS sug- gested that the crystals might correspond to zeolites (Si-Al-Ca) (Figure 11c). 202 V. Discussion The reactivity of basaltic rocks is normaly related to the presence of volcanic glass, altered minerals, SiO 2 content of the bulk rock (Korkanç and Tugrul, 2005) and pseudomorphs of quartz such as cristo- balite and trydimite (Diamond, 2000). Regarding alteration, volcanic glass tends to devitrify with time and one of the alteration products are clay minerals. Batic et al. (1994) studied basalts contain- ing volcanic glass and clay minerals and concluded that montmorilonite (or smectite) disseminated in the groundmass was the principal material involved in the ASR. Also Marfil et al. (1998) found out that the expansion of basalts was due to the occurrence of volcanic glass and its alteration products from devitrification, such as argillaceous minerals and poorly crystallized silica. It is important to mention that andesitic glass is considered not deleterious in general but it be- comes deleterious with the increasing silica content (> 62-65%) in the course of the crystallization of the magma (e.g. dacitic and rhyolitic glass) (Katayama et al., 1989). According to Katayama (2010) even basalts can contain alkali reactive rhyolitic glass. Many authors (Katayama et al., 1989; Korkanç and Tuğrul, 2005; Katayama, 2010) associated dacitic and rhyolitic glass with ASR. The petrography of the Santa Maria rock sam- ples and the SEM/EDS study showed that there were no deleterious species such as cristobalite and trydimite, opal or chalcedony. On the other hand the concrete petrography showed that there is vol- canic glass presented both in the coarse aggregates and in the sand fraction. Although the analysis is qualitative, the SEM/EDS study showed that the volcanic glass has a composition of high silica con- tent, which is the dominant component. The study performed in 1990 by the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) on the pavement of Santa Maria Island airport revealed 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands that the deterioration of the concrete was due to a complex process. This process involved expansive reactions associated with montmorillonite and zeo- lites (Braga Reis et al., 1996). According to Batic et al. (1994) similar results were obtained in basaltic rocks from Argentina in a study in which the NBRI test method was used to identify the behaviour of volcanic rocks. The petrographic examination confirmed that the products of the reaction origi- nated in the test were zeolites as the main material. In the present study also zeolites seem to be the most abundant product for the reaction affecting the airport concrete pavement. According to the conclusions in Batic et al. (1994) the minerals of al- teration of the rocks studied might have contributed to the reaction. Figure 6: Concrete petrography: aggregate particles and cement paste (cp) are shown. The aggregate particles show a high content of volcanic glass (vg) (PPL); a) light brown to yellowish; b) dark brown. In the interfaces there is a rim of fibrous zeolite (ze).

VI. Conclusion In order to evaluate the potential alkali reactivity of the aggregates of Santa Maria Island, a petrography study was carried out. The petrographic examination of both basanites showed that there were no forms of free silica. Both rock samples had similar mineral composition and textural features. The presence of olivine with thick iddingzitized rims, the occurrence of clay minerals and the high values of LOI indicated that the rocks have some degree of alteration. The alteration of these rocks could also be observed in situ in the reddish coloration of some areas of both quarries. The petrography of concrete samples identified volcanic glass both in the coarse and in the sand fraction. The SEM/EDS analysis indicated that the yellowish volcanic glass seemed to have, on a qualitative basis, a high content in Si. Under the optical microscope the cement paste showed abundant cracks with a typical pattern known as map-cracking and abundant needle- like/acicular crystals. This pattern could be as- sociated to ASR with the formation of zeolite-like crystals. The EDS analysis confirmed that the ce- ment paste is composed mainly by Si with lower contents of Al, Ca, Na and residual Mg. This com- position is similar to the alkali silica gel described in the literature of ASR and quite different from the usual composition of the cement paste. A number of aggregate particles are rimmed by a whitish material that also replaces the smallest particles of the sand fraction. According to the SEM/EDS analysis the white material has a com- position of Si-Al-Ca which might correspond to zeolite.

In order to understand the processes and components involved in the reaction, three quarries were selected from more than 50 granitic samples analysed in the scope of a research project. These quarries were mainly formed by medium to coarse-grained granitic rocks, which showed expansive behaviour when tested in concrete according to RILEM AAR-4.1 test-method. The petrographic analysis evidenced that besides the coarse quartz crystals with straight boundaries there were portions of granitic rocks in each batch of aggregate containing microcrystalline quartz and/or strained quartz. The optical microscopy analysis was complemented by the use of cathodoluminescence. The features presumably related to the potential reactivity of these rocks are presented and the usefulness of complementary methods discussed. Keywords: granitic aggregates, petrographic characterization, representativity I. Introduction Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a deleterious inter- nal chemical reaction which occurs in mortar and concrete involving certain forms of silica, namely opal, chalcedony, trydimite, cristobalite and Si-rich volcanic glass present in the aggregates. Opal and chalcedony are present in the so-called normally- reactive rocks (Lindgård et al., 2010). Concrete man- ufactured with aggregates containing these forms of silica (e.g. chert, some types of sandstone, volcanic rocks) exhibit cracks 5 to 20 years after the construc- tion. However, there are other aggregates, desig- nated as slowly-reactive (e.g. quartzite, cataclasite, gneiss) with which concrete structures show mani- festations of ASR at more than 15 to 20 years after construction. These may contain microcrystalline, cryptocrystalline quartz or quartz with variable de- grees of deformation. For these rocks the reactivity depends mainly on the textural and microstructural characteristics rather than on the mineralogical com- position and petrographic nomenclature (Wigum, 1995; Locati et al., 2010). A lot of research has been developed regarding the reactivity of rocks showing features of deforma- tion such as subgraining, bulging, strain lamellae, ribbons and stretched quartz, usually correspond- ing to an increase of the specific surface of the grains and a larger surface in contact with the pore solution in concrete. In literature there are exam- ples of the correlation between deformation fea- tures and expansion test results such as in Kerrick & Hooton (1992), Monteiro et al. (2001), Wenk et al. (2008) and Locati et al. (2010). Locati et al. (2010) refer that a mylonitised rock, affected by ductile and brittle-ductile deformation with development of cataclasis and pseudotachylytic veins, showed an increase of about 97% in reactivity with respect to the mylonitised sample, due to formation of sub- grains, grain size reduction and the presence of glassy material. On the other hand, Velasco-Torres et al. (2010) studied granitic rocks reported to origi- nate ASR in two concrete dams and concluded that micro-cracks work as facilitators for the access of the pore solution to the interior of the crystals of quartz, explaining the reactivity of some granitic rocks containing no microcrystalline quartz. More than 50 granitic aggregates have been stud- ied in the scope of the research project IMPROVE – Improvement of performance of aggregates in the inhibition of alkali-aggregate reactions in concrete, with the aim to evaluate the potential reactivity of different aggregate types and to define the best test method for the identification of the Portuguese aggregates reactivity. Bulk rock petrography was performed, as well as accelerated mortar-bar and 207 Fernandes et al. two different concrete prism tests. It was concluded that there was a better correlation between the re- sults obtained by petrographic aggregate examina- tion and the RILEM AAR-4.1 concrete prism test (Ramos et al., 2013; Santos Silva et al., 2014). Therefore, after the conclusion of the RILEM AAR-4.1 concrete expansion test, thin sections from two of the three tested concrete prisms were pro- duced. The petrographic analysis showed that dif- ferent features were observed in different particles of the aggregate within the same thin section of each concrete prism, revealing the heterogeneity of the quarries. The study of the prisms highlighted the importance of having representative sampling of the quarries and also that the petrographic study is a needful tool in the study of aggregates regard- ing ASR. Besides, the microscopic manifestations of ASR such as cracks and gel were signaled in order to understand which crystals and features were in the origin of ASR. In complement to the optical concrete petrographic characterization, cathodolu- minescence (CL) was applied to the same thin sec- tions. CL studies revealed the boundaries of the crystals and the opened intergranular spaces be- tween crystals which facilitate the percolation of the interstitial fluids of the concrete. This method showed also the proximity of feldspar crystals to the sites where alkali-silica gel was identified. This work aims at debating the importance of the detailed lithological and structural study of the quarries for the assessment of aggregates regarding ASR. It also presents the contribution of CL for the definition of the features of the rocks which seem to be in the origin of ASR. II. Materials and methods The granitic aggregates were studied according with the Portuguese Specification LNEC E 461 (2007) and RILEM AAR-0 (2015). Samples were collected from the stock piles in each quarry. Due to the need of having a total of about 70 kg of samples to perform the laboratory expansion tests, samples were picked up from piles corresponding to the different grain size fractions available in the quarries and which are used in concrete manufac- ture. For petrography, larger blocks of the rocks were collected. In the case of GR-C, also the mapping of the quarry was carried out in the scope of another re- search project. In consequence of the geological mapping, it was verified that there were veins of a fine-grained granitic rock cutting the main granitic mass. The fine-grained granite was also sampled as rock block for the petrographic analysis. It is worth mentioning that the fine-grained granite was ex- ploited with the medium-grained dominant granite and it was disseminated in the stock piles used for 208 concrete production and sampled for the laboratory tests. The petrographic analysis was the first method to be used in the assessment of aggregates regard- ing ASR, followed by laboratory expansion tests on mortar bars and concrete prisms. For the ac- celerated concrete prism method (RILEM AAR-4.1, 2015) three 75 ⇥ 75 ⇥ 250 mm concrete prisms were prepared with fine and coarse aggregate of the same granite and a CEM I type with an alkali content of 0.9% Na 2 O eq . The prisms were placed and sealed in a metallic container over water, which were stored in a climatic chamber generating constant temper- ature of 60 ± 2 C and relative humidity as close as possible to 100%. Periodic length measurements were made during twenty weeks. The limit con- sidered of potential reactivity was of 0.03% at 20 weeks following the conclusion in Lindgård et al. (2010). Two sets of thin sections were produced. The first set of thin sections was obtained from the sam- ples of rock as received from the quarries. The blocks were cut in three orthogonal directions to produce the thin sections so that any anisotropy that the rock might show could be observed. The second set was composed of thin sections of the concrete prisms of GR-A and GR-B. At the end of the expansion tests, the prisms were cut with a dia- mond saw in slices, impregnated with epoxy resin to reinforce the sample material, seal off porosity and reduce preparation artefacts, and lapped by hand using silicon carbide powder to produce pol- ished thin sections of 25 ⇥ 43 ⇥ 0.030 mm, using the same methods as for the rock thin sections. Miner- alogical and textural characteristics of the samples were obtained by the analysis of these thin sections, which were studied using a Nikon Eclipse E400POL petrographic microscope in plane polarized light (PPL) and crossed polarized light (XPL). Photomi- crographs were obtained using a Zeiss MRc5 cam- era and Axiovision software. CL studies were car- ried out on the polished thin sections using a hot cathode CL microscope HC3-LM from the Centre of Geology of Faculty of Sciences of University of Porto. The system was operated at 14 kV and a fila- ment current of 0.18 mA. The samples were coated with gold using Cressington 108Auto equipment to prevent any build-up of electrical charge dur- ing the CL analysis. Luminescence images were acquired during the CL analysis with an adapted digital video-camera (KAPPA PS 40C-285 (DX) with dual stage Peltier cooling) and an acquisition time between 5.51 and 8.02 sec.

The results of the expansion tests at 20 weeks performed according with RILEM AAR-4.1 are also presented. The three granitic rocks selected were all classified as potentially reactive by the petrography and the concrete prism test per- formed according to RILEM AAR-4.1 (2015). One of the samples (GR-C) was also reported as reactive in field structures. GR-A is composed of medium grained two-mica granite containing subhedral crystals of variable di- mensions. The main volume of rock shows quartz crystals with straight to slightly convex boundaries (Figure 1). However, locally the quartz crystals show sutured boundaries and some subgraining in the borders of the larger crystals. K-feldspar is very perthitic, plagioclase crystals are altered, mainly in the cores. Myrmekites are abundant. There are frequent symplectic fringes in the mus- covite crystals which are usually smaller than the plates of biotite. The larger crystals of quartz and feldspar are strongly cracked. GR-B corresponds Sample 1 Heterogranular. Quartz crystals with straight boundaries and slight undulatory extinction. There is microcrystalline quartz as inclusions and as myrmekites. Sample 2 Fine-grained.

Quartz shows undulatory extinction but the crystals have straight boundaries, locally slightly sutured. There is rare microcrystalline quartz as inclusions in the crys- tals of feldspar (Figure 2). K-feldspar is usually altered and forms the larger crystals. Plagioclase is mainly altered in the core of the crystals and exhibits sericitization. The crystals of muscovite are larger than the biotite crystals, which are more elongated. Biotite is locally chloritised. GR-C is composed of two facies which were observed at the scale of the quarry. In the quarry the medium- grained granite, with no manifestations of deforma- tion, is dominant (Figure 3a and 3b). Locally, the rock showed stronger alteration and higher content of biotite. Quartz presents straight boundaries. The larger crystals are of K-feldspar, usually showing albitization and moderate alteration. Plagioclase crystals are sericitized, mainly in the core. There is another generation of smaller crystals of plagio- clase with defined twinning and without signs of alteration. Biotite and muscovite crystals occur as- sociated to each other. The crystals of biotite are Figure 1: In GR-A straight to sutured boundaries dominate. Undulatory extinction is observed in the larger crystals of quartz; microcracks are abundant (NX). 209 Fernandes et al. Fernandes et al. Figure 2: In GR-B the crystals of quartz show straight boundaries with no features of deformation. The smaller crystals of quartz occur as inclusions in K-feldspar. The crystal boundaries are lined with iron oxides (NX). smaller and slimmer than the muscovite. They are locally chloritised containing needles of rutile. Muscovite exhibits symplectitic fringes. Microcrys- talline quartz occurs as inclusions in feldspar crys- tals and in abundant myrmekites. The rock shows some opened cracks. The fine-grained granite of GR-C is composed of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and muscovite, with rare biotite (Figure 3c and 3d). The boundaries of the crystals are concave-convex, commonly sutured. Feldspar crystals are slightly altered. There are euhedral crystals of quartz which contain inclusions of muscovite disposed in rims within the quartz. In this granite quartz is mainly microcrystalline (< 100 µm) both in the matrix and as inclusions in the larger crystals of K-feldspar. The study of the concrete thin sections of GR- A and GR-B allowed the observation of different important aspects: • The variability of the aggregates present in each sample; • The identification the manifestations Figure 2.

In the thin section of the concrete prism produced with GR-A particles, besides the medium-grained above described, fractions of deformed granite were identified. The mineral composition is similar to the one already described but there are different textural features, namely abundant subgraining in alignments along the boundaries of the larger crys- tals. Microcrystalline (<100 µm) to cryptocrystalline (<10 µm) quartz is quite common. Tiny inclusions of quartz and myrmekites are abundant (Figure 4). Deformation is also visible in the bent cleavage planes of the mica crystals. The concrete prism thin section of GR-B con- tains mainly particles of the granitic rock described above. However, there are particles of coarse ag- gregate with quite different characteristics. It cor- responds to a tectonite of granitic composition in which there are manifestations of strong deforma- tion and moderate alteration, with plagioclase crys- tals almost completely sericitized. There is pre- ferred orientation and alignment of the minerals, the larger crystals of quartz are cracked and show strong undulatory extinction, mica crystals exhibit flame-like planes of cleavage and strain lamellae (Figure 5). The main characteristic in what concerns alkali-reactivity is the subgraining and abundant cryptocrystalline quartz along alignments that may correspond to shear zones. Both deformed and not- deformed aggregate particles are cracked, and the boundaries of all the crystals are lined with iron oxides. Regarding the manifestations of ASR, in the thin sections of GR-A and GR-B, rims of gel around some coarse (> 4 mm) aggregate particles were identified. Cracks occur cutting the aggregate par- ticles. These cracks develop perpendicular to the interface cement paste-aggregate particle and they extend to the cement paste, containing scarce alkali- silica gel. The cracks dominantly develop along the intergranular spaces of the crystals of quartz. The gel observed is colorless to brownish, without a defined internal structure. Colorless gel forms the rim in the interfaces between the cement paste and the aggregate particles while the brownish gel is observed filling the cracks that cut the aggregate particles, close to the boundaries in contact with Figure 5: Strongly strained granite in GR-B, showing bending of the cleavage planes of mica crystals. There is intense subgraining of quartz, usually in alignments in the boundaries of the larger crystals (NX). 211 Fernandes et al. Fernandes et al. a) b) Figure 6.

(2010) this effect can be en- hanced in granite containing myrmekite or perthite structures, like the ones studied. The application of CL in complement of other petrographic methods, namely the optical microscope and the scanning electron microscope, has been investigated by a number of authors (e.g. Götze, 2009; Št’astná et al, 2012) and it is known to be a crucial methodology in the identification of minerals and observation of alteration and cracking. In the present study, CL al- lowed the observation of the microstructure closely related to the occurrence of alkali-silica gel, namely the open intergranular spaces and the dissolution around the cracks in the feldspar crystals. V. Conclusion The main conclusion of the work here presented is that ASR is not only related with the presence of microcrystalline and strained quartz but it seems to be facilitated by the presence of microcracks. The possible contribution of the feldspars and/or muscovite can also be inferred by the petrographic study of the concrete prisms. In the three quar- ries, medium-grained granite is the dominant rock. However, the production of concrete prisms thin sections from GR-A and GR-B alerted to the fact that different features can be found within the same quarry. About 70 kg were sent to the laboratory taken from the piles which are directly used for the manufacture of the concrete, containing unde- formed and deformed rocks. For the third quarry, a geologist was involved in the geological mapping and therefore the different facies were identified at the scale of the quarry, allowing that a correct representative sampling was made. In this case, the potentially reactive rock occurs is limited areas. During the quarrying operation, this fine-grained rock is mixed with the innocuous rock in an un- known content, generating ASR. The heterogeneity of the quarries can give, or not, potential reactive aggregates in consequence of the relative content of the reactive fraction. Therefore, the main note is that it is important to establish in the standards the need of the involvement of geologists in the mapping of quarries in special when there are sig- nificant zones of deformed rock or fine-grained facies. The performance of concrete petrography allowed the identification of manifestations of ASR, after the expansion tests have classified these ag- gregates as Class II (potentially reactive to alkalis). The use of CL helps in the definition of the features of the particles likely to originate ASR.

The main forms of silica which can occur in volcanic rocks are silica-rich volcanic glass, opal, tridymite and cristobalite. An interesting case was observed during a long-term research study carried out in the laboratories of Ege University, Izmir. The expansion results of the concrete prisms of the basalt samples provided from an aggregate source have recently showed completely different expansion results compared to the expansion results of the aggregate that was brought to the laboratory from the same region, Aliağa, 9 years before. Bulk chemical analyses were carried out and polished thin sections of samples of both batches were produced in order to perform the petrographic assessment of the aggregate aiming to understand the reasons for the different performance in laboratory. Visual analysis of the micrographs was performed by Matlab. The observation under optical microscope was conducted by scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and by electron probe micro-analysis. It was concluded that the samples present similar texture and mineral composition but different degrees of alteration. The potential reactivity was attributed to the abundant silica-rich volcanic glass in the groundmass. Keywords: volcanic rocks, petrographic characterization, visual analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis I. Introduction Alkali-silica reactions (ASR) are deleterious reac- tions in concrete which occur when simultaneously three components are available: alkalis, usually present in the cement paste; moisture conditions and reactive forms of silica as components of the aggregates. Some forms of silica are universally ac- cepted as being potentially reactive, namely amor- phous and poor crystalline silica: opal, Si-rich vol- canic glass, tridymite, cristobalite and chalcedony. Volcanic rocks have been found to be alkali reac- tive in a number of regions and countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Czech Republic, China, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and Turkey (e.g. Gudmundsson & Asgeirsson, 1975; Shayan & Quick, 1988; Katayama et al., 1989, 1996; Deng et al., 1996; Marfil et al., 1998; Munhoz et al., 2008; Román et al., 2008; Vola et al., 2011). How- ever, different components have been pointed out as possible cause of reactivity of volcanic rocks. It is believed that dacitic and rhyolitic volcanic glass (SiO 2 > 65 wt%) can be alkali-reactive (e.g. Katayama et al., 1989; Katayama, 1997, 2010, 2012; Wakizaka, 2000; Koga et al., 2011), as was also con- firmed by Shayan & Quick (1988) for an Australian basalt with a glassy matrix containing 67wt% SiO 2 . Previous studies on Turkish rocks showed that re- activity of andesites with intermediate to acidic composition was due to the presence of volcanic glass, alteration minerals and SiO 2 content (>50%) (Korkanç & Tuğrul, 2004, 2005). Volcanic glass tends to alter to zeolites, clay min- erals and silica minerals (Coombs, 1961) which, according to some researchers, might be involved in alkali-silica reaction. For example, Batic et al. (1994) studied basaltic aggregates from Argentina and concluded that smectite-type clays were in the origin of ASR while Marfil et al. (1998) found out that the expansion of basalts was due to the occur- rence of volcanic glass and its alteration products from devitrification, such as argillaceous minerals and poorly crystallized silica. Opal, a reactive form of silica, was identified by Katayama & Kaneshige (1986) in Japanese moderately altered volcanic rocks belonging to the smectite zone. In a recent work Tiecher et al. (2012) identified a residue from the sudden cooling of volcanic magmas (mesostasis) 215 Fernandes & Andiç-Çakır Figure 1: Geological map of Bozdivlit mountain and its surrounding. which had different crypto-microcrystalline silica phases, including quartz. In the course of a long-term research project developed by the laboratories of Ege University, Izmir in the scope of the assessment of the poten- tial reactivity of Turkish aggregates an interesting case was observed. The alkali silica reaction expan- sion results of the andesite batch provided recently showed completely different expansion results com- pared to the expansion results of the same quarry aggregate that was brought to the laboratory from the same region, Aliağa, 9 years before. In conse- quence of these uneven results, the need to clarify the performance of the different batches was raised. In the present work various methods have been used in order to detect the possible differences be- tween the two batches of aggregates. The results of the bulk chemical analysis, the mineralogical and textural characteristics, as well as analyses of the volcanic glass that forms the groundmass of the rock are presented. II. 2. Materials and methods The two batches studied in the scope of the present work are 9 years aside. They are named "old sam- ple" (OS) and "new sample" (NS). The aggregate quarry from which the old and the new samples were provided is located in the skirts of Bozdivlit Mountain, Çaltılıdere, Aliağa (Figure 1). According to the reports of Turkish General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA), the rocks located in the region are named as Bozdivlit Andesitic Basalts (Eşder et al., 1991). Upper Miocene-aged rocks are also referred to as basalts, basaltoids and basaltic andesites by other researchers (e.g. Çopuroğlu et al., 2009).

The location where the NS was taken is characterized by columnar joints as shown in Figure 2, in a compacted less altered rock mass. The quarry shows heterogeneous characteristic and the rocks exhibit different behaviour depending on the vertical location from where they are exploited. The study performed followed the recommenda- tions in RILEM AAR-0 (2003) as explained in the following paragraphs. The methodology was: • Petrographic analysis of rock samples (AAR-1, 2003) • Bulk rock chemical analysis • Ultra accelerated mortar bar test expansion (AAR-2, 2003) • Concrete prism test expansion (AAR-3, 2003) in two modalities: with constant alkalinity; with boosted alkalis to 1.25% Na 2 O eqv . • Concrete petrography of the mortar and con- crete samples after the laboratory expansion tests were over. The samples for the chemical and petrographic analyses consisted of the gravel fraction of the man- ufactured aggregate from the quarry. From each sample (OS and NS) three portions composed of several particles were selected. Geochemical analyses of major elements were performed on six pieces of aggregate at Acti- vation Laboratories (ACTLABS), in Canada, by inductively-coupled plasma – atomic emission spec- trometry (ICP-AES). The petrographic analysis of rock and the con- crete petrography were carried out under petro- graphic microscope and by scanning electron micro- scope (SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Polished thin sections were prepared with 25 ⇥ 43 ⇥ 0.030 mm dimensions and were studied with a polarizing microscope Nikon E 400 POL. The objective was the identification of potentially reactive forms of silica in the aggregate and of man- ifestations of ASR in the concrete prism specimen. SEM-EDS (High Resolution Schottky Environmen- tal Scanning Electron Microscope: Quanta 400 FEG ESEM/EDAX Genesis X4M: 15 kV and 10.0 mm working distance) was used to obtain the qualita- tive micro-analysis of the volcanic glass composi- tion for both samples and to confirm the occurrence of ASR products. In addition, the thin sections were analysed by electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) JEOL JXA-8200 in order to obtain quantitative com- positions of the volcanic glass. For SEM/EDS and EPMA analyses the polished thin sections were coated with carbon. In order to determine the ASR expansions by the AAR-3 method, three concrete prisms of 285 mm length and 75 ⇥ 75 mm cross-section were cast. Af- ter the specimens were kept at 20 ± 2 C in a moist environment (>90% RH) for 24 h, they were de- molded. Then, initial comparator readings (l o ) were obtained in a room maintained at 20 ± 2 C. For storage, standard containers capable of containing three specimens were used. Specimens were trans- ferred to two standard sealable containers which Table 2: Chemical analysis of bulk rock for the two samples.

III. Results Concrete Prism Expansion tests As above referred the aim of the present work is to explain the different results of laboratory tests per- formed with two different batches of the aggregates collected from the same quarry. Table 1 shows the expansion data of the samples provided at differ- ent periods, 9 years apart, named as old sample (OS) and new sample (NS), respectively. The rec- ommended limit for AAR-3 was proposed in an international large-scale EU-funded project (PART- NER) (Lindgård et al., 2010). It can be seen that the ultra-accelerated mortar bar expansion results of the NS are above the limit showing the reactivity potential of the aggregate while its 52 weeks AAR-3 expansion is considerably low, compared to the ex- pansions of the OS and the limit value. In addition, increase in total alkalinity of concrete samples has an important effect on total expansions. A recent study conducted on NS aggregate has revealed that using a high amount of NS powder and cement dosage as in the case of self-compacted concrete mixture leads to expansion levels above the proposed limit (Yüksel et al., 2014) Chemical analysis of bulk rock The contents of major elements (as oxides) were obtained together with loss on ignition (LOI) (Table 2). The projection of the results of 6 fractions of rock (3 of the OS and 3 of the NS) were plotted on a TAS diagram which indicates both samples correspond to andesites (Figure 3). The SiO 2 content of the NS is slightly higher than that of the OS. The values for LOI indicate that the samples show some alteration, higher for the NS.

Contrary to the chemical analysis, the manifesta- tions of alteration of the phenocrysts are more fre- quently observed in the OS (Figure 6). The olivine xenoliths are usually replaced by carbonate miner- als but also cryptocrystalline quartz was observed. An example is presented in Figure 7 where it can be observed that the mineral is intensely altered and silica forms nodules in the centre of the altered crystal. The main petrographic characteristics of the sam- ples are summarized on Table 3. K, Na, Ca and Mg. The main component is always Si, followed by Al. From the qualitative analysis based on the spectra, the volcanic glass of the NS seems to be richer in Si, in relation to the content of Al, than the OS. In addition to this study, EPMA were performed. On Table 4 the results obtained are presented, each column corresponding to the mean value of 4 anal- yses. It can be confirmed that the composition of the volcanic glass has much higher silica content than the bulk rock.

In addition to the identification of ASR signs it could be observed that some of the aggregate parti- cles in the concrete samples showed slight different characteristics in relation to the thin sections of the manufactured aggregate particles. This was especially visible for the OS in which altered an- desite particles were more abundant. The most altered particles showed stronger manifestations of reaction, namely rims of fibrous crystals in the interfaces between the aggregate particles and the cement paste. These rims were dark yellow un- der PPL and had very low birefringence under XPL, with the acicular/fibrous crystals in radial disposition. Under higher magnification they corre- sponded to rosette-like agglomerates (Figure 11). IV. Discussion The role played by the volcanic glass and by the minerals of alteration on the development of ASR is not yet totally understood. The study developed started with the findings on a laboratory tests with contradictory results with sam- ples from the very same quarry. The first approach was related to the need to determine the bulk chem- ical composition of the two different batches of aggregates in order to find out if reactive samples were oversaturated in silica. However, the results obtained (59.84% for the OS and 60.27% for the NS) were not different enough to sustain the dif- ferent behaviour based on the content of silica of both samples. The chemical analysis of the OS was very similar to the results already published in Çop- uroğlu et al. (2009). The composition of both the OS and the NS was of the same order for all the ox- ides. Both samples have SiO 2 content >50wt.% and could therefore be classified as potentially reactive to alkalis. The second step was the performance of petro- graphic analysis in order to identify the main dif- ferences between the OS and the NS. This study revealed that in both cases the matrix is more abun- dant than the phenocrysts and that the main com- ponent of the matrix is volcanic glass. There is, however a slight difference in that the content of the matrix seems to be higher for the OS than for the NS, which contains larger and more numerous phenocrysts. However, this could not be confirmed by image analysis. b c Figure 11: Fibrous crystals observed in rims in the boundaries of the aggregate particles of the OS. a) Photomicrograph under PPL; b and c) SEM images (BSE). 223 Fernandes & Andiç-Çakır It is well known that the crystallization of the magma generates a residual melt which is richer in silica and, therefore, in volcanic rocks the volcanic glass will have a higher content in silica then the bulk composition of the rock. In this context, and according to the results of other researchers already referred above, SEM/EDS analyses were carried out as well as EPMA on the volcanic glass that occurs in the matrix of different fractions of the two batches (OS and NS). The results obtained are encouraging as they allow the classification of the volcanic glass as having dacitic to rhyolitic composition and being potentially reactive to alkalis. Again, the results are far from explaining the different performance of the OS and the NS observed in the laboratory tests. Following the conclusion of the laboratory tests, the thin sections produced for concrete petrogra- phy brought some interesting information. Even at the scale of the thin section, it is possible to notice that there is some variability in the quarry, mainly in what concerns the OS. In fact, a number of al- tered particles were observed showing the presence of clay minerals which were only discrete in the thin sections of the manufactured aggregate. The concrete petrography analysis led to the identifica- tion of cracks, some partially filled with alkali-silica gel. These cracks develop dominantly parallel to the interfaces of the aggregate particles with the cement paste, but also perpendicular, extending to the cement paste and connecting to other particles of aggregate. There are rims of fibrous minerals which are quite different from the manifestations of ASR found in other types of rocks but similar to what has been observed with volcanic rocks (Medeiros et al., 2014) and also to the ones already published in Çopuroğlu et al. (2009). In addition, in a recent study developed by Yük- sel et al. (2014) it was verified that the increase in the amount of filler-sized NS and higher cement dosages (470 kg/m 3 instead of 440 kg/m 3 ) led to higher AAR-3 expansions. This situation is related with the composition and amount of siliceous ma- terials, alkalinity and permeability of concrete mix- ture. Thus, it can be concluded that reactivity of aggregate seems to be dependent on various factors in addition to type and amount of siliceous phases present. V. Conclusions The results obtained in the present study do not totally explain the origin of the potential reactivity of andesites to alkalis but it might contribute with some clarification. From all the tests carried out, it could be con- cluded that both samples’ compositions indicate potential reactivity, due to the SiO 2 rich volcanic 224 glass. Volcanic glass is the main component of these andesites but is more abundant in the OS as this sample shows lower density in phenocrysts and small size of the crystals. Also, the volcanic glass is denser in the OS and forms darker rims around some of the phenocrysts. Regarding alteration, the OS shows stronger alteration than the NS with clay minerals replacing some phenocrysts of pyroxene and plagioclase. In consequence of the results ob- tained, it is believed that the degree of alteration of the rocks might have influenced the development of the ASR in the OS. Based on previous experience, NS aggregate has the potential to show reactivity if certain conditions are met. The concrete petrography of the concrete prisms specimen suggests that there is variability of the features of the rocks, namely related to different de- grees of alteration and that the most altered pieces of rock were the ones exhibiting more evident man- ifestations of ASR. The origin of the rims in the interfaces, showing features different from ASR in other types of rocks, also deserves some attention and further study.

However, there are still some gaps in the understanding of the ASR-suppressing mechanisms. They concern the influence of aggregate characteristics on the effectivness of LiNO 3 to supress ASR. In this study concrete and mortar are used to address this specific question. Concrete and mortar were investigated by SEM combined with EDX. The effectiveness of LiNO 3 to suppress ASR is dependent on the specific surface area of the reactive aggregate. Whereas only minor amounts of reaction products limited to the surface are formed on the dense artificial aggregate, a substantial amount of reaction products are formed in a porous artificial aggregate with high specific surface area. Keywords: Alkali-silica reaction, prevention, concrete, lithium I. Introduction In the last years the understanding about the mech- anisms enabling LiNO 3 to limit the extent of alkali- silica reaction (ASR) in mortar and concrete has improved (Tremblay et al., 2010; Feng et al., 2010a; Feng et al., 2010b; Leemann et al., 2014). As shown on mortar samples, LiNO 3 considerably alters the composition and the porosity of the ASR prod- uct leading to a dense phase limiting the diffu- sion of ions to reactive minerals (Leemann et al., 2014). Additionally, it is possible that the lithium- containing reaction product is less expansive than the lithium-free reaction product. In model systems LiNO 3 addition changes the structure of the reac- tion product from one dominated by Q 3 (layers of SiO 2 -tetrahedra) to one dominated by Q 2 (chains of SiO 2 -tetrahedra) (Mitchell et al., 2004; Leemann et al., 2014). A structure dominated by Q 3 seems to be better suited to adsorb alkalis compensating the negative charges of these layers. Such a higher binding capability of alkalis can lead to higher bind- ing capability of water. As the alkalis form effective hydrogen bonding networks with water molecules and are able to stabilize large amounts of water in the reaction product (Kirkpatrick et al., 2005), a reaction product dominated by Q 3 may have a higher swelling potential. The current study extends the investigation made on mortar (Leemann et al., 2014) on concrete and focuses on one pending question about the effect of LiNO 3 on ASR: it is still unclear why LiNO 3 is effective with some aggregates but not with others (Fournier et al., 2003; Folliard et al., 2006; Tremblay et al., 2007). Two concrete mixtures with natural ag- gregates were produced: one as a reference without additions and two with LiNO 3 addition. Mortars with corresponding compositions were produced. A very dense SiO 2 -cylinder and a highly porous SiO 2 -filter were embedded as artificial aggregates in the mortars to investigate the effect of specific surface area on the ASR-supressing effect of LiNO 3 . The composition of the reaction products in con- crete and mortar was analyzed with scanning elec- tron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). II. Materials and methods Materials An ordinary Portland cement (CEM I 52.5 R, Table 1) was used to produce concrete and mortar mix- tures. The mix design of the concrete and mortar is shown in Table 2. Gneiss aggregates with a grain size of 0/22 mm (0/4 mm: 35 mass-%, 4/8 mm: 19 mass-%, 8/16 mm: 21 mass-%, 16/22 mm: 25 mass-%) were used for the concrete and for the mortar a grain size of 0/4 mm. Three prisms per mixture with a dimension of 70x70x282 mm 3 were cast with the concrete. The mortar was filled into a cylindrical container with a diameter of 54 mm and a height of 45 mm. Two artificial aggregates were embedded in the mortar, a SiO 2 -cylinder (diameter: 10 mm, length: 25 mm) and SiO 2 -filter disc (diame- ter: 20 mm, height: 4 mm). Both consist of highly 227 Leemann Table 1: Composition of cement in mass-%. Material CEM I 52.5 R SiO 2 20.16 Al 2 O 3 5.29 Fe 2 O 3 3.25 Cr 2 O 3 0.01 MnO 0.06 pure SiO 2 -glass (SuprasilR). The SiO 2 -cylinder is dense material without measureable porosity. The SiO 2 -filter is highly porous (total porosity of 35-40 volume-%) with a pore size of 10-16 µm accord- ing to the producer. The samples for SEM analysis were dried in an oven at 50 C for three days, epoxy impregnated, cut to obtain cross-sections of the mortar/aggregate interface, polished and carbon coated. Due to the high brittleness of the artificial glass aggregates, small particles continuously splin- tered during polishing leading to a relatively high surface roughness within these aggregates. Methods The potential alkali reactivity of the concrete was measured according to AFNOR P18-454 at 60 C and 100% relative humidity. The length of the con- crete prisms was measured every 4 weeks for 40 weeks. After 24 weeks one prism of concrete Ref and Li 0.74 was removed for analysis with SEM. Concrete Li 0.37 was not analyzed. The mortar samples were investigated at the same age. SEM images were acquired using an ESEM-FEG XL30 in the high vacuum mode (2.0-6.0 ⇥ 10 6 Torr) with an accelerating voltage of 12 kV and a beam current of 260-280 mA in the backscattered electron mode (BSE). The chemical analysis was conducted with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). An EDAX 194 UTWdetector, a Philips digital controller, and Genesis Spectrum Software (Version 4.6.1) with ZAF corrections were used. The reaction prod- ucts were analyzed in six to seven aggregates per concrete mixture, resulting in a total of about 200 analyzed points per concrete. Approximately 150 points were analyzed in each mortar per artificial SiO 2 -aggregate. TiO 2 0.29 P 2 O 5 0.22 CaO 62.71 MgO 1.65 III.

The lower dosage in concrete Li-0.37 is not effective in reducing ex- pansion. Concrete Li 0.37 and Li 0.74 show a mass increase (Figure 1B), while concrete Ref stabilizes at its initial weight at the age of 16 weeks after an initial mass loss. The morphology of the reaction products in con- crete Ref shows a layered texture with some mi- crocracking as a result of drying due to sample preparation (Figure 2A). The reaction product in concrete Li 0.74 is significantly more homogenous and has no layered texture (Figure 2B). Differences are present as well in the chemical composition of the reaction products of the different concrete mix- tures. The reaction product in concrete Ref is in the usual range of ASR products present in aggregates (Leemann and Merz, 2013). The chemical compo- sition of the reaction products in concrete Li 0.74 is entirely different (Figure 3). The majority of the analyzed point shows a lower alkali concentration and significantly lower calcium concentration in relation to silicon compared to concrete Ref. These data are in agreement with Kawamura and Fuwa (2003) and Leemann et al. (2014). Mortar The SiO 2 -cylinder embedded in the mortars shows a rim of reaction products in mortar Ref (Figure 4A). Additionally, some channel-like dissolution features filled with reaction products penetrate into the SiO 2 - Table 2: Mix design of the concrete and mortar (Mk = Metakaolin) Concrete Cement [kg/m 3 ] Additions [kg/m 3 ] Aggregates [kg/m 3 ] Water [kg/m 3 ] w/b 228 concrete Ref 400 - 1776 192 0.48 concrete Li 0.37 400 LiNO 3 : 2.8 1770 192 0.48 concrete Li 0.74 400 LiNO 3 : 5.6 1770 192 0.48 mortar Ref 600 - 1318 300 0.50 mortar Li 0.74 600 LiNO 3 : 8.1 1297 300 0.50 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 1: Expansion (A) and mass change (B) of concrete Ref, Li 0.37 and Li 0.74 versus time.

The reaction product shows a Ca/Si-ratio in the range of 0.15-0.20 and a (Na+K)/Si-ratio in the range of 0.3-0.4 (Figure 5A). The SiO 2 -cylinder in mortar Li exhibits only a very thin ( ⇠ 1 µm) layer of reaction product identifiable by the in- creased backscattering contrast compared to the SiO 2 -cylinder and the cement paste (Figure 4B). Be- cause of its dimensions the compositions of the thin layer in mortar Li cannot be determined re- liably (Figure 5B): the interaction volume of the electron beam can be expected to extend from the reaction product into the SiO 2 -cylinder and the ce- ment paste. After 6 weeks the SiO 2 -filter in mortar Ref shows an ingressing front of reaction products into a depth of 0.5-1.0 mm. After 24 weeks reaction products are precipitated in the pores of the filter through the entire cross section of 4 millimeters. They are more abundant in a distance to the interface with the cement paste of 0-1 mm than in the midsection of the filter. The same distribution of the reaction products is present in the filter embedded in mortar Li 0.76 (Figure 6). However, the amount of reaction products is lower assessed qualitatively compared to mortar Ref. In a distance to the interface with the cement paste of about 50 micrometers the reaction products in all mortars contain calcium leading to a molar Ca/Si-ratio between 0.05-0.50 after 24 weeks. In greater depth the Ca/Si-ratio varies between 0.01 and 0.05. The reaction products mainly contain potassium as alkalis reflecting the composition of the cement used. The molar (Na+K)/Si-ratio of the reaction products does not vary systematically across the filter and is in the range of 0.1-0.3 (see Figure 5B). There are no systematic differences in the composition of the reaction products in the different mortars as determined with EDX. IV. Discussion The addition of LiNO 3 in a Li/(Na+K)-ratio of 0.74 clearly leads to a significant reduction of expan- sion. Moreover, morphology and composition of the reaction products are changed the same way as already observed in mortars with LiNO 3 addi- tion (Leemann et al., 2014). The reaction product is Figure 2: ASR products in concrete Ref (A) and concrete Li 0.74 (B) in veins located in gneiss aggregates. 229 Leemann Figure 3: Atomic ratio of (Na+K)/Si versus Ca/Si in the reaction products of concrete Ref and Li 0.74. dense and texture-less (Figure 3B). Its alkali and cal- cium contents are considerably decreased (Figure 4). As postulated in Leemann et al. (2014) the effective- ness of LiNO 3 is caused by the formation of a dense product protecting reactive minerals from further dissolution and by the formation of a reaction prod- uct with lower expansion potential. In order to have this impact on ASR-induced expansion lithium has to be present in a sufficient concentration in the pore solution of the concrete. Obviously, the addi- tion in the lower dosage (Li/(Na+K) = 0.37) is not effective at all with the aggregate used. As shown in several studies the required LiNO 3 addition de- pends on the aggregate used (Fournier et al., 2003; Folliard et al., 2006; Tremblay et al., 2007). The artificial aggregates in the mortars clearly show that the surface area of an aggregate is influ- encing the effectiveness of LiNO 3 to suppress ASR. While the dense SiO 2 -cylinder shows only a thin layer of reaction product on its surface, there is a substantial amount of reaction product present in the SiO 2 -filter. The occurrence of this situation has to be related to the change of pore solution compo- sition with time. In general, lithium concentration in the pore solution decreases with time (Tremblay et al., 2008; Leemann et al., 2014). As the surface of the SiO 2 -cylinder is in contact with mortar pore so- lution from the time of sample production, it reacts at a time where lithium concentration in the pore solution is still high. This first dense reaction layer is capable of protecting the SiO 2 -cylinder from any further reaction even after lithium concentration in Figure 4: A. SiO 2 -cylinder in mortar Ref with reaction rim at the surface and channel-like dissolution features, B. SiO 2 -cylinder in mortar Li with thin reaction rim at the surface (please note the difference in magnification compared to A) 230 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 5: Composition of the reaction products of the embedded SiO 2 -cylinder (A, including the transition between cement paste and reaction product) and the SiO 2 -filter (B, from the interface towards greater depth) in mortars Ref and Li 0.76 at the age of 24 weeks. the pore solution has decreased. As such, the postu- lation that the dense reaction product formed in the presence of lithium protects reactive minerals from further reaction (Leemann et al., 2014) seems to be correct. In the case of the SiO 2 -filter, the distribution of the reaction products in the filters and their com- position indicate the formation of a reaction front within the filters. As the difference in the distribu- tion of the reaction products after 6 and 24 weeks shows (Figure 6), the formation of reaction products reaches greater depth after a longer reaction time. Additionally, calcium concentration decreases sig- nificantly in a depth > 50-100 µm (Figure 6). This clearly indicates that the high surface area of the SiO 2 -filter makes it likely that the reaction between pore solution and SiO 2 is proceeding over weeks even at a stage where the lithium concentration in the pore solution has decreased considerably. As a consequence, the lithium available is not sufficient anymore to form a protective layer as observed on the surface of the SiO 2 -cylinder and an expansive reaction product is formed. This effect of the spe- cific surface area is clearly related to change of pore solution composition with time. There might be an additional effect in aggregates of high specific sur- face area. Alkalis are continuously removed from the ingressing pore solution due to the reaction with SiO 2 . As potassium and sodium are adsorbed slower by reaction products than lithium (Tremblay et al., 2008; Leemann et al., 2014), they may lead to a reaction in parts of the filter not (yet) reached by lithium. However, this is purely hypothetical. Such a mechanism would likely lead to the formation of a lithium front that penetrates less far into the filter than the sodium and potassium front. ToF-SIMS measurements should allow detecting such a front as the method is able to analyze lithium distribu- tion with high spatial resolution (Leemann et al., 2014; Bernard and Leemann, 2015). Specific surface area has a significant influence on the effectiveness of LiNO 3 to suppress ASR as demonstrated with the SiO 2 -cylinder and the SiO 2 -filter. As such it can explain, why the effectiveness of LiNO 3 and the re- quired dosage to suppress ASR is dependent on the type of aggregate (Fournier et al., 2003; Folliard et al., 2006; Tremblay et al., 2007). The specific surface area and the dissolution kinetics of reactive SiO 2 in natural aggregates can be expected to vary consid- erably and is surely difficult to assess. Therefore, the required dosage of LiNO 3 is best determined with expansion tests. V. Summary and conclusions In this study the effect of LiNO 3 was analyzed in concrete with natural aggregates and in mortar with two artificial SiO 2 -aggregates of different specific surface area. Based on the results obtained in con- crete and mortar the following conclusions can be drawn: • The reaction products in concrete Li-0.74 are dense and texture-less contrasting to the lay- ered texture and higher porosity of the reaction product in concrete Ref. Moreover, the sodium, potassium and calcium content in the reaction products of concrete Li-0.74 are significantly reduced. This indicates that the decrease in expansion can be attributed to a protection of reactive minerals from further reaction by the dense reaction product and likely to a reaction product with less expansion potential. • The dense SiO 2 -cylinder in mortar Li-0.74 shows no reaction products except of a thin and dense surface layer ( ⇠ 1 µm wide). This surface layer protects the SiO 2 -cylinder from further reaction. This seems to verify the hy- 231 Leemann Figure 6: Backscattered electron image (BSE) and element mappings of calcium (Ca), potassium (K) and silicon (Si) at the interface of the SiO 2 -filter to cement paste in mortar Li 0.76 after 6 (row on left) and 24 weeks (row on right). Reaction products correspond to the areas with a lower silicon signal compared to the unreacted SiO 2 of the filter and to the areas showing a potassium signal. 232 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands pothesis made based on the results of con- crete Li-0.74 on the protective effect of lithium- containing reaction products. • The SiO 2 -filter in mortar Li-0.74 contains a sub- stantial amount of reaction products even if it is lower than in the one in mortar Ref. The occurrence of these reaction products in the SiO 2 -filter clearly indicates that the difference in effectiveness of LiNO 3 to prevent the forma- tion of reaction products is dependent on the specific surface area of aggregates. The surface layer on the SiO 2 -cylinder likely formed soon after sample production when the lithium con- tent in the pore solution was still high. In the SiO 2 -filter a reaction fronts ingresses with time. This limits the effectiveness of lithium to pre- vent ASR. At the time the reaction front reaches the inner parts of the SiO 2 -filter, lithium con- centration in the mortar pore solution has de- creased to a level where it is only partly ef- fective. Moreover, the lithium content of the ingressing solution may continuously decrease by the ongoing reaction with SiO 2 . Sodium and potassium may penetrate further than lithium and lead to the formation of reaction products in the filter not (yet) reached by lithium. • LiNO 3 is able to decrease ASR-induced con- crete expansion when it is added in a sufficient amount that depends on the specific surface area of reactive SiO 2 in the aggregates. • It is essential to investigate the lithium distri- bution in the two artificial SiO 2 -aggregates to verify the effect of specific surface area on the effectiveness of LiNO 3 . Such an investigation could be made with ToF-SIMS on impregnated and polished samples of the mortars as the method permits lithium analysis with high spa- tial resolution (Leemann et al., 2014; Bernard and Leemann, 2015).

Although this type of rock is regarded as slow/late reactive or even non-reactive to alkalis, numerous reports indicate its deleterious behaviour in several major structures. The urge to avoid this problem led to the development of the Portuguese project IMPROVE (Improvement of performance of aggregates in the inhibition of alkali-aggregate reactions in concrete). Under the scope of this investigation, Portuguese aggregates of different lithologies have been studied, including the granitic ones presented in this paper. The used methods included petrographic characterization and performance tests: mortar-bar and concrete expansion tests. The results indicate that the content of microcrystalline quartz correlates better with the results of the concrete prism expansion tests than with the ones of the mortar-bar expansion test. In this paper, evidence is given to the type of quartz of the granitic aggregates which proved to be reactive both in expansion tests and/or in concrete structures. Keywords: ASR; granitic aggregates; petrographic characterization; expansion tests I. Introduction Alkali-aggregate reaction, which includes the alkali- silica reaction (ASR) and the alkali-carbonate re- action, is a chemical reaction in either mortar or concrete involving the hydroxyl (OH ) ions associ- ated with the alkalis from Portland cement or other sources, with certain mineral phases that may be present in the aggregates (RILEM AAR-6.1, 2013) leading to the premature distress and loss in ser- viceability of the affected concrete structures. The importance of textural features of aggregates in the development of ASR started to grab the atten- tion of researchers around the 1950s (Brown, 1955). In the following two decades, several studies were published trying to establish a correlation between the values of the undulatory extinction of quartz crystals and the deformation degree of the crys- tal’s lattice (DeHills and Corvallán, 1964; Gogte, 1973). This parameter was later on used in the in- vestigation of the potential reactivity of aggregates (e.g. Dolar-Mantuani, 1981). Afterwards, it was verified that quartz grains presenting high undu- latory extinction angles were usually associated to the presence of microcrystalline quartz ( < 100 µm) (Grattan-Bellew, 1992), which showed a high sol- ubility due to a large surface area. The presence of microcrystalline quartz then became the most important parameter in the evaluation of the po- tential reactivity to alkalis of quartz-bearing rocks. Tiecher et al. (2012), after investigating deformed quartz-rich aggregates, concluded that rocks mainly composed by quartz crystals with a well-defined undulatory extinction and deformation bands are highly prone to the development of ASR. Shayan (1993) had already attributed the occurrence of ASR to the presence of microcrystalline quartz, stating that the reaction occurs at the grains’ boundaries in zones that contain the grained quartz and with a large surface area. In 1995, Wigum proposed a new approach for the quantification of the av- erage surface area of quartz crystals in cataclastic rocks which allowed to estimate the quantity of microcrystalline quartz present in the rock. The presence of myrmekites, defined as a vermicular intergrowth of quartz and sodic plagioclase formed by replacement of K-feldspar, typically in deformed granitic rocks (Vernon, 2004), was also considered by Wigum (1995) as a preferential site for ASR. Several studies also showed that there is a posi- tive correlation between the amount of microcrys- talline quartz, resulting from the conversion of a 235 Ramos et al. Table 1: Codification, lithology and age of the studied granitic rocks according to Dias et al. (2010).

In spite of microcrystalline quartz being pointed out as the major phase responsible for ASR in slow reactive aggregates, other minerals such as micas and feldspars have been suggested to be also to be prone to this deleterious reaction (e.g. Yan et al., 2004; Hagelia and Fernandes, 2012). Though granitic aggregates are usually pointed out as being innocuous or unlikely reactive to al- kalis (Concrete Society, 2010), the literature on the subject shows that this type of rocks can behave, in some parts of the world, as reactive (RILEM AAR-1, 2003). In Portugal, granitic rocks are the second most commonly used material in the con- struction of major concrete structures and several ASR cases involving this kind of aggregates have been reported and investigated (e.g. Fernandes et al., 2004; Santos Silva, 2005). The behaviour of such material towards ASR is complex and the current methodologies of assessment have not proven to- tally satisfactory. The study presented in this paper, and which is included in the Project IMPROVE (Improvement of performance of aggregates in the inhibition of alkali-aggregate reactions in concrete), aimed not only for predicting the behaviour of Por- tuguese granitic rocks, but also for establishing the expansion test that best suits the field performance of this slow reactive aggregates. II. Materials and Methods Under the scope of the Portuguese project IM- PROVE, eight granitic aggregates from active quar- ries from northern and central Portugal were in- vestigated. All the investigated granitic rocks out- crop in the Central Iberian Zone and are Hercynian in age (Dias et al. 2010). These are designated according to the nomenclature established by the aforementioned project (Table 1). The aggregates were assessed by petrographic characterization followed by expansion tests, namely, the accelerated mortar-bar test at 80 C and the concrete prism tests at 60 C and 38 C. A total of about 100 kg of crushed aggregate of different grain sizes was collected from each quarry. Hand samples were selected in order to produce thin- sections with the following dimensions: 25*35*0.03 mm Petrographic characterization The thin-sections were studied with an optical po- larizing microscope Nikon Eclipse E 400 POL, cou- pled with an automatic PELCON point-counter and with a photographic camera Zeiss Axio Cam, avail- able at "Centro de Geologia da Universidade do Porto" (CGUP). The evaluation of the reactivity fol- lowed the methodology described in RILEM AAR- 1.1 (2013) and in LNEC E 461 (2007), which de- fine similar reactivity classes (Class I - non-reactive; Class II - potentially reactive; Class III - reactive). It was based in the quantification of microcrystalline quartz ( < 100 µm) plus myrmekites, and in the mea- surement of the undulatory extinction angle. This last parameter was evaluated according to the pro- cedure described in DeHills and Corvállan (1964) and with the classification in the Portuguese speci- fication LNEC E 415 (1993).

All expansion tests were carried out at " Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil" (LNEC). A CEM I 42.5 R cement from Alhandra (Portugal) was used for the manufacture of mortar and concrete spec- imens. The cement had an alkali content ranging from 0.86 to 0.89 Na 2 Oeq.

SEM-EDS (High Resolution Schottky Environ- mental Scanning Electron Microscope: Quanta 400 FEG ESEM/EDAX Genesis X4M: 15 kV and 10.0 mm working distance) was used to confirm the oc- currence and to identify the composition of ASR products in the polished thin-sections previously studied by petrographic methods. The SEM-EDS examination was performed along X-ray microanal- ysis and electron backscattered diffraction analysis at "Centro de Materiais da Universidade do Porto" (CEMUP). Samples were coated with carbon by a vacuum evaporator equipment JEOL JEE - 4X. All the images presented in this paper were made in backscattering mode. III.

All the other aggregates are classified as Class I (non-reactive) by the aforementioned recom- mendation/specification. Figure 1 illustrates the evidence of potentially reactive silica forms as well of undulatory extinction in the investigated aggre- gates. Sometimes, microcrystalline quartz presents as tectonized quartz. Expansion tests The performance of the granitic aggregates in the expansion tests is displayed in Figure 2. Figure 2A shows that all aggregates used in the accelerated mortar-bar test at 80 C expansions lower than 0.10 % at 14 days.

The concrete prisms both from RILEM AAR-3 and RILEM AAR-4.1 are those that exhibit the most severe manifestations of ASR from all the tested samples. The thin-sections analysis showed there is gel mainly in the cracks and voids that occur in the interfaces between the aggregate particles and the cement paste. However, in the thin-section of the RILEM AAR-3 prism there are also cracks cross- ing the aggregate particles. These cracks are wider close to the interface with the cement paste and are thinner inside of the particles. The alkali-silica gel identified is compact, non-crystalline and exhibits several shrinkage cracks. Figure 4 presents images and the qualitative anal- ysis of gel in the border of the aggregate particles from an RILEM AAR-3 prism. This dense gel is disposed in layers lining the void and crack. The colour is slightly darker (brownish) than commonly found in voids and it presents abundant shrinkage cracks. Besides the procedures applied during the production of the thin-sections, the vacuum typi- cal of SEM observations can also create shrinkage cracks. As already stated, there is some variation in the content of Ca in the analyses performed al- though the gel exhibits a similar texture. The results obtained for the prism tested accord- ing to RILEM AAR-4.1 are presented in Figure 4. The gel is compact and forms in layers in the aggre- gate particle boundaries. Aggregate GR3 The thin-sections produced from the concrete prisms tested under the RILEM AAR-4.1 condi- tions show very discrete manifestations of ASR. Gel occurs in slim cracks in the boundaries of the ag- gregate particles and in rare cracks crossing the aggregate particles. The examination performed with SEM-EDS confirms that the gel is composed mainly of Si with high content of Ca and very low content of K and Na. However, some Al was also detected. A crack crossing an aggregate particle was also analysed in order to identify the material inside the crack. It shows a particulate texture not common in gel. The EDS analysis indicates a composition close to that of gel but with very high content of Ca and scarce Al (Figure 5). IV. Discussion The obtained results for each method are summa- rized in Table 5. According to the petrographic characterization, only aggregates GR1, GR2 and GR18 present per- centages of microcrystalline quartz above 2.0 vol.%, which classify them as Class II according to RILEM AAR-1.1 (2013) and LNEC E 461 (2007) (Ramos, 240 2013). Aggregate GR2 is clearly distinguishable for having the higher volume of microcrystalline quartz, which presents itself mainly as tectonized quartz, followed by aggregates GR18 and GR1. Though all the other granitic aggregates are re- garded as non-reactive (Class I), the Portuguese experience, in which LNEC E 461 (2007) is based, establishes the use of concrete expansion tests as compulsory to complement the petrographic char- acterization. As demonstrated in Figure 6, there is a positive but moderate correlation between the percentage of microcrystalline quartz and the undulatory ex- tinction angle (correlation coefficient r = 0.41). For example, aggregate GR2 exhibits by far the highest content in microcrystalline quartz, but it is aggre- gate GR18 that shows the quartz grains with the highest undulatory extinction angles. However, both aggregates are classified as Class II by petro- graphic examination. Also, aggregate GR19, which is rated as Class I, presents a very similar value of extinction angle to aggregate GR2, but a much lower content of microcrystalline quartz in compar- ison to the same aggregate. Furthermore, the aggre- gates presenting the lowest angles of undulatory extinction seem to establish a better correlation with the percentages of microcrystalline quartz, plotting close to the regression line. The above is in accordance with West (1991, 1994), who pointed out undulatory extinction angle as a possible indicator of potential alkali-reactivity of rocks, rather than a diagnostic feature. The comparison between the results of the pet- rographic examination and the ASTM C 1260 con- firmed that the accelerated mortar-bar test was not able to support the results of the petrographic ex- amination in what concerns aggregates GR1, GR2 and GR18, classifying all the granitic aggregates as non-reactive. Though this method is widely used for the assessment of aggregates for concrete pur- poses, it is still not well recognized that its limits correspond to the reactivity of some of the slow reactive aggregates, leading to their incorrect classi- fication as false non-reactive (Shayan, 2007), which is surely the case of aggregate GR2 and GR18. This method has not been successful when performed on Portuguese granitic aggregates and, therefore, it has been considered as inappropriate to evaluate the alkali-reactivity of this type of slow reactive rocks (Santos Silva, 2005). The explanation for the results obtained might remain in the findings re- ported by Lu et al. (2006a,b), in which it is stated that the crushing of rocks to obtain very fine aggre- gates can destroy the original microstructure and thus underestimate the alkali reactivity of the rocks in accelerated mortar-bar tests. In fact, the influence of the size of the aggregate particles used in labora- tory tests has been discussed and results published Ramos et al. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands A1 A2 B2 B1 A1 Ramos et al.

Today, mainly polycarboxylate ethers (PCE) are used as superplasticizers in concrete. The number and amount of additives for concrete has increased in recent years. The main reasons for using these supplementary cementitious materials are saving CO 2 -intensive Portland cement and to increase the performance of the concrete. The effectivity of superplasticizers on certain additive or fine filler grains is therefore of major interest. The distribution of PCE molecules within a hardened cementitious matrix can be measured after PCE is stained by a fluorescing dye via UV-microscopy or laser scanning microscopy (Wetzel et al. 2015). Using such FITC-stained PCE molecules in a suspension of fine binder and inert particles the absorbance was analyzed. For these analyses a special flow-through cell was build, which enables the in-situ measurements via UV-microscopy as well as via laser scanning microscope. Compared to existing methods measuring the adsorbance of admixtures on inorganic particle surfaces, this novel method gives the possibility for in-situ observations. Keywords: polycarboxylate ether, cement, supplementary cementitious materials, FITC, UV-microscopy I. Introduction To achieve a specific workability of mortars and concretes polycarboxylate ether based superplasti- cizers (PCE) are added as admixtures. These super- plasticizers adsorb on particle surfaces and effect dispersion by a combination of electrostatic and steric repulsion of the particles the superplasticiz- ers are adsorbed on. Beneath improvement of the workability these superplasticizers enable a low wa- ter/binder ratio and therefore improve the strength and durability. Due to this, the use of superplasti- cizers in high performance concretes is necessary. PCE’s are characterized by an adsorbing backbone and side chains made up by hydrophilic polyethy- lene oxides (Plank et al. 2008). The adsorbance of PCEs on particle surface depends on the charge of the particle surface or more precisely on the zeta potential of the particles. The zeta potential in turn is influenced by early hydration in case of ce- mentitious systems (Plank, Hirsch 2007). A proofed method analyzing the affinity of absorbance of poly- mers on mineralic particle surfaces is TOC (total organic carbon). This method, which often is cou- pled to zeta potential measurements, is an ex-situ measurement, whereas the method used in these investigations displays a novel in-situ method. The localization and much more the quantifica- tion of organic admixtures within building mate- rials is difficult due to the low size of admixtures, which are only some nanometer big in maximum in case of PCEs. Illustrations of PCE-comb-polyers ad- hering on inorganic particles are drawn oversized many times (Figure 1). II. Methods Materials Polycarboxylate ethers are usually used in combi- nation with a low amount of defoamers, because beneath plasticizing these PCEs tend to stabilize air voids. In these investigations superplasticizers without defoamers were used and measurement artefacts caused by defoamers can be neglected. The inorganic particles used in this investiga- tions are (a) Portland cement clinker, (b) ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), (c) quartz powder (d) lime stone powder and (e) corundum. The corundum was chosen as a particle type with exemplarily low zeta potential in contrast to the other particles with rather high zeta potential. To locate the superplasticizer via UV-microscopy it is necessary to bind a fluorescent dye, in this case fluorescein iso-thiocyanate (FITC), chemically to the PCE-molecule. FITC binds effectively to amino- groups, which are usually not represented in PCEs. It is kind to introduce these functional groups by a linker molecule e.g. ethylene diamine. This way, FITC can be bond to the superplasticizer easily. 249 which often is coupled to zeta potential measurements, is an ex-situ measurement, whereas the method used in these investigations displays a novel in-situ method. The localization and much more the quantification of organic admixtures within building materials is Wetzel & Arend difficult due to the low size of admixtures, which are only some nanometer big in maximum in case of PCEs. Illustrations of PCE-comb-polyers adhering on inorganic particles are drawn oversized many times (Fig. 1). A. Wetzel and J. Arend Methods Materials Most time the adsorbance of superplasticizers are displayed on sketches, where polymers drawn much much too Figure 1: Figure Mostly 1: the adsorbance of superplasticizers are displayed on sketches, where the the polymers are are drawn too big. big. Polycarboxylate ethers are usually used in combination with a low amount of defoamers, because beneath plasticizing these PCEs tend to stabilize air voids.

Subsequently, the stained PCE-solution concentration on the particles surfaces increases continuously reaching a maximum after about 75 seconds in case of the aluminium oxide. The intensity of the solution increases as well, but then decreases after about 75 seconds.

It could be observed that an increase of Ca 2 + -ions increased the fluorescence intensity and therefore the adsorbance of PCE with a maximum at the concentration of 0.02 mol/l. In order to find a correlation between clinker phases and absorbance of PCE a combined SEM- UV-microscope test series was conducted. Particles fixed on a substrate were analyzed via SEM gain- ing secondary electron pictures and element maps (EDX). The secondary electron picture gives infor- mation about the topography of the cement particle and the element map gives information about the clinker phase distribution especially the differenti- ation between alite/ belite and aluminate/ferrite. Subsequently, the stained PCE-solution is added on the particle and the distribution is estimated via UV-microscopy. It was assumed to find a correlation of enrichment of PCE and the distribution of aluminate/ferrite-phases due to early formed et- tringite which promotes the adsorbance of PCE. Such a correlation could not be found (Figure 4b), for which further improvement of the experimental setup might be necessary. However, an enrichment on kinks and edges were not found as well. The concentration of superplasticizers in solution must be chosen low in order to keep an intermedi- ate pH-value. In case of higher concentrations the pH-value had to be corrected by a high concentra- tion of hydroxides. This has been done by KOH and Ca(OH) 2 . In both cases the measured adsor- bance decreased. An explanation for that might be the complexation and counter-ion condensation of PCE with the cations of the alkali hydroxides (Plank, 2009). In order to proof the concept of measurement, an additional test series was conducted measuring corundum powder with a grain size in the range of the particles measured before. Corundum showed a strong adsorbance and therefore a much shorter exposure time was necessary. Therefore, it was possible to gain a time series in which the develop- ment of adsorbance within the first minutes could be analyzed in-situ. The concentration on the par- ticles surfaces increases continuously reaching a maximum after about 75 seconds in case of the aluminium oxide.

This might be interpreted by a diffusion controlled enrichment on particle surface accompa- nied by a decrease within the solution. Additional tests will be done to check these effects i) on par- ticle with different mineralogical composition and ii) with different starting concentration of the PCE- solution. IV. Conclusion A new approach measuring the adsorbance of su- perplasticizers on the surfaces of inorganic particles were developed using FITC-stained polycarboxylate ether in a flow cell. The distribution of the poly- mers were measured in-situ via UV-microscopy. An enhanced adsorbance can be observed for Portland cement and GGBFS, followed by limestone. Quartz powder shows the lowest adsorbance of PCE which might be explained by the mainly negative zeta po- tential. The adsorbance of PCE could be increased in case of quartz particles by increasing the Ca 2 + - ion concentration. A correlation between clinker phase distribution and PCE-distribution by a com- bined SEM-UV-microscope approach could not be proofed yet. Therefore, the experimental setup need to be reconsidered and maybe improved. Generally, it could be shown that the adsorbance of PCE on mineralic surface can be measured as a function of electrolyte concentration in-situ. Using corundum as test reference a short exposure-time was necessary and therefor beneath the effect of cation-concentration a temporal evolution of adsor- bance could be measured.

The morphology, as well as the chemical composition, of this phase is dependent on the surrounding solution composition. The presence of alkali salts appears to impact the morphology of C-S-H at early ages which at the same time seems to influence its ability to fill the pore space at later ages. An ordinary white Portland based cement system is compared to systems with the additions of NaOH and Na 2 SO 4 , two Na-salts which accelerate the hydration of Portland cement at early ages. In the plain white cement, C-S-H adopts a needle type divergent morphology which grows outwards from the surface of cement grains. The presence of NaOH seems to lead to a C-S-H morphology which is more parallel to the surface, without growing outwards. On the contrary, Na 2 SO 4 leads to a C-S-H morphology comparable to the one in the plain system, thus sulfate ions seem to correct the morphology of C-S-H or avoid the presence of a more planar C-S-H morphology adopted in the presence of NaOH. Keywords: C-S-H, hydration, microstructure, alkalis, sulfate I. Introduction It is generally accepted that alkalis accelerate the hy- dration of Portland cement (at least initially), which usually leads to a higher strength development at early ages. However, alkalis may have a detrimental impact on strength at later ages (Jawed and Skalny, 1978). At present there is no clear explanation of the impact of alkalis to Portland cement. However, this has not been systematically confirmed and find- ings in the literature are often contradictory (Kumar et al., 2012; Škvára, 2007; Way and Shayan, 1989). In this study, we combine the information from Secondary Electron (SE) images and Backscattered Electron (BSE) images to analyse respectively the morphology of C-S-H at early ages (during the ac- celeration period) and its ability to fill the pore space at later ages. II. Experimental Materials The chemical composition (analysed by X-ray Flu- orescence) of the white cement used for the exper- iments is: 24.40 wt.% SiO 2 , 2.12 wt.% Al 2 O 3 , 0.32 wt.% Fe 2 O 3 , 68.13 wt.% CaO, 0.56 wt.% MgO and 1.94 wt.% SO 3 . Two alkali solutions were prepared: 1.45M NaOH and 0.725M Na 2 SO 4 were dissolved in water prior to being mixed with cement to ensure a homogeneous distribution. Methods 40g of cement were mixed with de-ionized water (DI-water) or the appropriate aqueous solution of NaOH or Na 2 SO 4 to achieve a water to cement (w/c) ratio of 0.4. Care was taken to minimize exposure to the air to limit carbonation during the mixing and casting process, and the pastes were stored in sealed conditions at 20 C. The heat release was recorded by isothermal calorimetery. The ambient temperature was con- trolled at 20 C. 10 grams of paste were placed in glass vessel and then into the calorimeter. The surface of the grains was observed at dif- ferent times during hydration, with a FEI XLF-30 SFEG-SEM in SE mode. The overall development of microstructure was observed on polished sec- tions with a FEI quanta 200 SEM microscope in BSE mode. The operating conditions are shown on the micrographs or indicated in the captions. For all the microscopy samples the hydration was stopped by solvent exchange technique with isopropanol. For the SEM-SFEG specimens (frac- tured surfaces), 0.5g of the paste was taken out from the sealed sample at the required times and immediately stirred (retention filter f > 5 µm) with isopropanol in a funnel for 3 minutes to remove the water. A small amount of the dried powder was dispersed on an adhesive carbon tab. To ensure electrical conductivity in the SEM, a conductive carbon layer of 10-15 nm was deposited on top 255 Mota et al. for 2 days. It was followed by impregnation of a piece of the slice (a square of ⇠ 1.5cm side and ⇠ 3mm height) in a low-viscosity epoxy resin, polish- ing with a diamond powder down to 1µm. They were further stored in dessicator for 2 more days and they were coated with a Ballec CED 030 car- bon coater. EDX measurements were done with a Brucker AXS XFlash dectector for Energy dispersive X-ray analyses. III. Figure 1: Heat release of each sample over the first 24 hours. Full dots in the nucleation and growth period indicate the time at which hydration was stopped to study the mid-way of this period. with a Cressington carbon coater. To ensure a good representativity, a minimum of 10 grains were ana- lyzed. For the BSE specimens (polished samples), a slice (f t 2.5cm, s 3mm height) was cut at 7 and 28 days from the rest of the paste sample and the hydration was stopped by immersion in iso- propanol for 6 days and further stored in dessicator Results Figure 1 shows the evolution of the heat release from isothermal calorimetry as a function of the hydration time (the first 24h). It is observed that both Na-salts lead to a steeper slope during the acceleration period, an earlier occurrence of the silicate peak and a shorter induction period. Figure 1 shows the times at which hydration of cement was stopped to analyse the morphology of C-S-H in SE mode. For each system, the samples were studied at the middle of the nucleation and growth period with a similar degree of hydration in order to follow the morphology of C-S-H during its early growth. Not only is the kinetics changing with the ad- dition of alkali salts but also the morphology of C-S-H. SEM morphology observations with SE in Figure 2 show the following: • In the reference cement system (Figure 2a) Figure 2: SE micrographs show the surfaces of cement grains covered with C-S-H at the middle of the acceleration period (full dots in the calorimetry curve): a) plain white cement – 6h30, b) with NaOH – 2h30 and c) with Na 2 SO 4 – 4h30.

SEM operating conditions: 15 kV, working distance 12.5 mm, spot size 4, current 0.12 nA, magnification 10,000 ⇥ . The images were selected to be representative of the whole matrix. the C-S-H has a tendency to grow outwards from the surface with a needle-like morphol- ogy. Those needles can grow in a divergent morphology or sometimes they appear to grow in parallel. Somecrystals of CH can also be observed in Figure 2a. • The addition of NaOH (Figure 2b) leads to a more planar, foil-like C-S-H. It is not growing outwards generally but closer to the anhydrous cement grain surface. • The addition of Na 2 SO 4 (Figure 2c) does not show the same behaviour as NaOH. C-S-H leads to a more divergent morphology (similar to the plain system). The same divergent effect was checked to take place when adding of gyp- sum to the system with NaOH. This suggests a competition between the effect of sodium (probably earlier in time) and sulfate ions, thus their impact on the kinetics for C-S-H growth when combined needs to be further studied. 2D microstructure at later ages studied by SEM using BSE images and polished sections of later ages in Figure 3 show that the Na 2 SO 4 (Figure 3c) leads to a similar distribution of hydrates than the plain one (Figure 3a): C-S-H is the main phase that fills the space (inner and outer product) including some elongated crystals of CH. This confirms that a divergent morphology of C-S-H during the accel- eration period will allow it to grow outwards from the surface to better fill the porosity. On the con- trary, in the case of NaOH (Figure 3b), BSE images reveal limited growth of outer C-S-H, being difficult to identify it. This can be linked to a more planar, foil-like C-S-H observed during the nucleation and growth period which is not able to grow outwards and, consequently, is not filling the space as it does in the other two systems. The small plates of CH observed in Figure 3b appear to be the main phase filling the space. Figure 4 shows the EDX-SEM analysis (atomic ratios) of the samples at 7 days of hydration. The divergent morphology of C-S-H observed in the presence of sulfates could result from a higher sul- fate sorption on C-S-H product. Care was taken to avoid EDX analyses of C-S-H near other phases like CH crystals or anhydrous grains. The EDX analysis were done at a magnification of 5,000 ⇥ where it is possible to identify which are the areas of interest to be analyzed. C-S-H can include sulfate which co-adsorbs with calcium ions, therefore a cor- rected value for calcium is used according to (Ca – S) which assumes that every sulfate ion adsorbed on C-S-H has done so with one calcium ion. IV. Conclusion In this work, we observe that the addition of alkali salts accelerates the hydration of cement during the first hours and at the same time influence the 3D morphology of C-S-H. In the presence of NaOH it is not possible to identify a clear needle structure in C- S-H but more planar as it is not growing outwards 257 Mota et al. Figure 4: Al/(Ca-S) ratio versus S/(Ca-S) ratio resulting from the EDX analysis of the C-S-H product at 7 days of hydration. Operating conditions: spot size 5.5, 15kV, working distance 12.5 mm, current 0.8 nA. from the surface. On the contrary, Na 2 SO 4 results in a similar 3D morphology of C-S-H compared to the plain system and the addition of sulfate seems to be a clear determining factor for a divergent needled-structure as suggested by EDX analysis . The morphology of C-S-H during the acceleration period seems to impact its ability to fill the empty space at later ages. In the plain cement system, SEM-BSE images allow the observation of a matrix of hydrates where C-S-H product is easy to identify as it mostly fills all the space. On the contrary, the addition of NaOH clearly leads to a different matrix distribution in which the space does not appear to be filled by C-S-H product. This study demonstrates the influence of the chemical composition of the pore solution on the 3D morphology that 258 C-S-H adopts at early ages of hydration. It is also possible to see that changes induced on the C-S-H at very early ages may have a remarkable impact on the development of the final matrix of hydrates. At the same time, it may have an impact on the compressive strength, as well as e.g. porosity. This needs to be further studied. References Jawed, I., and Skalny, J.

Optical microscopy is coupled to advanced image analysis, as well as statistical data analysis to characterize heterogeneous concrete material. The article takes a closer look at the determination of the w/c ratio through the analysis of capillary porosity by using image analysis. It is shown that accurate analysis does not shown identical results in the w/c ratio even for standard reference samples with known w/c ratio. In the article it is shown that this is not because the techniques we use to determine the w/c ratios are not accurate enough, but much more because of the local variation in the microstructure. The attention shifts with this article from the analysis technique to what we actually observe in the microstructure. Hopefully this will change our thinking about the distribution in local microstructure variation and will help to set off more research towards the capturing and modelling of these local microstructure variation into consequences at a more structural level. Keywords: water-cement ratio, microscopy, thin section, image analysis, microstructure distribution I. Introduction Some things never seem to change and yet they do. It seems like we are making concrete already more than 100 years in much the same way. We require a certain amount of rocks (both fine and coarse), ce- mentitious material and water to make our trusted, well known concrete material. To be sure we can rely on the quality of our concrete materials the standards regularly prescribe e.g. minimum ce- ment content, maximum water-cement ratios, and more if deemed necessary, see (European Standard- ization Committee, 2009). However, times are changing. Slowly but surely our way of making concrete changes from a pre- scriptive way of defining and regulating our con- crete to a more performance based approach (Eu- ropean Economic Community, 2011). Driven by the increased attention for sustainability, allowing a wider range of material components to be part of our concrete, thus fulfilling the wish to reuse and recycle, making concrete by prescribing its compo- nents and the recipe is not enough anymore. A need is emerging to determine and satisfy perfor- mances of the concrete material which goes beyond the 28 day strength alone. In this article a trip is taken to characterize mate- rial based on its microstructure. Optical microscopy is coupled to advanced image analysis, as well as statistical data analysis to characterize heteroge- neous concrete material. It is thought that this can be a way forward in determining material perfor- mance in an ever growing world of different ways and components to make concrete. Before the material characterization is described, a start is made at the structural level; what does the structural engineer need and how does he deal with uncertainties in available data? With this illus- tration in mind a change in scale and representative volume is made to go down to the microstructure level and its heterogeneity. How accurate can we determine this through the proposed methods, and how can we deal with the uncertainties found in this process? II. The structural design approach Just to serve as an example reference is made to the North Boulevard Bridge project in the city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana (McLellan, 2009). Here Louisiana’s first high performance concrete bridge was built, open to traffic in 2006. The bridge aes- thetics were provided by the smooth surfaces of the graceful and slender precast, prestressed concrete U-beams, and the uniquely sculptured concrete arch-shaped piers, see Figure 1. To design the box girder, the structural analysis and calculation required a minimum strength of 69 MPa (10,000 psi) at 56 days as one of the per- formance requirements for the concrete. The term minimum already indicates there could be a varia- 259 de Rooij & Mendonça Filho Figure 1: The North Boulevard Bridge in Louisiana made from high strength concrete tion in the strength of the produced beams. In other words, standing below the bridge, looking up at the box girders, there is certainly one that is the weak- est, but which one would this be? If a coring sample would be necessary from the box girders to check the strength, which beam should be taken and how many samples would be needed to indicate if the performance has been met? Keep this example in mind when we come back to a similar choice in sampling for microstructure characterization. With the performance requirement set, the next step is to design a concrete mix that can fulfil the requirement. In concrete design it was the research work of Abrams (Abrams, 1918) that showed a simple relation between the concrete strength and its water-cement ratio. Abrams’ law as it became known, effectively states that for workable concrete, the lower the water-cement ratio, the higher the strength of the concrete. Abrams reported his re- sults through Figure 2, using a water-cement ratio by volume. As nowadays the water-cement ratio is defined by mass, the graph has been replotted in Figure 3, considering that the cement density used by Abrams was 94 lb. per cubic ft. (Abrams 1918). The mathematical expression Abrams came up with to aid the material design was a marvelous simplification of all the various components and influences on the measured compressive strength. However, often it is forgotten that it was just an aid in the design process. Taking a closer look at Figure 3, it shows two things. First of all, the w/c ratio should be at the very low end of the scale, probably towards 0.20. Second, even the data of Abrams did not provide a clear strength value for a specific w/c ratio. It is more of a range. In concrete technology, the possible variation in compressive strength is so well known, that it is sometimes forgotten or overlooked when consider- ing materials properties of concrete not related to strength. Hence, just as a reminder a quick recapit- ulation. Take e.g. a ready-mix truck of concrete. It is one batch, all mixed in the same procedure. In practice you do not get much more homogeneous concrete than this. Now use this batch of concrete completely to produce standard cubes or cylinders, which are stored under standard conditions and all tested after 28 days for compressive strength. The results from a testing point of view could Figure 2: Original plot from Abrams (Abrams, 1918), using water-cement ratio by volume 260 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 3: Replotted Abrams graph, using water-cement ratio by mass be considered strange, because the compressive strength values are not all the same (see Figure 4) even though all the samples are produced from the same batch and hence are from a composition (recipe) point of view all identical. Nevertheless we have come to accept this variation as part of the inherent heterogeneity of concrete. In fact, being able to capture the distribution of the results in a Gauss curve, we have learnt to deal with the material variation at a structural design level. It is exactly the reason why the needed structural strength as a performance requirement is specified as a minimum strength or sometimes characteristic strength. For the North Boulevard Bridge project the high performance mix proportions used came to be with a w/c ratio of 0.25. A little over 10 liter of high- range water reducer was necessary per m 3 to main- tain a workability of the concrete within the spec- ified range. The compressive strength from the concrete produced from this high performance mix was followed and measured based on test cylin- ders for 23 castings. After 1 day the compressive strength was on average already 47 MPa with a range of 28 - 60 MPa. After 28 days the numbers had increased to an average value of 94 MPa with a range of 68 - 109 MPa. Hence, the minimum strength requirement of 69 MPa after 56 days was not a problem. It is interesting to note that the variation in the results reduces in the relative sense when going from 1 day test results (spread around 30%) to 28 day test results (spread around 20%). Nevertheless, going back to the original design where the struc- tural engineer had designed the entire structure with a compressive strength of 69 MPa, it is fair to state that the vast majority of the bridge material has a strength well above the design strength. III. Connection to the material microstructure From the previous section it is clear that the con- crete used is not a homogeneous material, but has a distribution, at least for the property of strength. Figure 4: Example of strength distribution of one batch of concrete (histogram) 261 de Rooij & Mendonça Filho Figure 5: Schematic of optical microscope in transmitted light mode to examine a thin section specimen. A specimen with more porous microstructure shows brighter than a denser microstructure due to the difference in the amount of epoxy present in the microstructure. This is not a problem for structural engineers be- cause they define their performance requirements in terms of a minimum or characteristic strength. One could ask if this heterogeneity is also present for other material properties of concrete. If so, it could perhaps help us to understand why certain parts of the structure degrade faster than other parts. It could help us in the understanding why the ingress of substances like e.g. chloride does not have a uniform frontline like in our models, but has instead a much more variable front. In order to see if it is possible to detect such microstructural difference a closer look is taken at the concrete microstructure. Staying with the parameter strength, it was the re- search work of Abrams that linked the compressive strength of workable concrete to the water-cement ratio. Even though for normal concrete mix design, the concrete with w/c = 0.25 is outside the workable concrete range specified by Abrams, addition of a high-range water-reducing admixture created the right direction for designing a high performance concrete. Hence, even in this particular situation, the w/c ratio introduced by Abrams was not that far off. It helped in the design direction. Following this importance of the w/c ratio, would it then be possible to also use the w/c ra- tio to characterize the material microstructure of concrete? In earlier times this first connection was made by Idorn (Idorn, 1967) and later by Thaulow and co-workers (Thaulow et al., 1982). The reason- ing behind this was relatively simple. If a material has a certain property like strength, the value of that property should come from the material itself; in other words, its microstructure. A material with a 262 weak microstructure would result in a material with a low compressive strength. Also, if the material microstructure would show strong characteristics, then the material as a whole would probably show strong. The next step in the reasoning may have caused some misconception in the past. Historically, the reasoning is as follows. If the microstructure is responsible for the overall performance of the ma- terial, and if the microstructure is determined by its components then knowing the amount of com- ponents, like knowing the amount of water and the amount of cement (the water-cement ratio) cre- ates a direct relation to properties like strength. Hence, reasoning shows that it is perfectly logical that Abrams found that water-cement ratio plays such an important role in the determination of the compressive strength of concrete. Two mistakes were made in this reasoning. First the microstructure of a material is not only deter- mined by its components (its mix design), but also by the process in which it is made (e.g. temperature, mixing, placing, curing, etc.). Second, the water- cement ratio had obtained too strong a position in the determination of the compressive strength. It had gotten to the point that the water-cement ratio determined the strength. However, already in the work of Abrams it is shown that one unique water- cement ratio does not result in one unique value of the compressive strength. Nevertheless, led by the Nordic countries in Eu- rope a method was developed and turned into a NORDTEST standard (NT Build 361 (Nordtest 1991- 02), 1991), based on the analysis of microstructure using thin sections and optical microscopy. The 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands method has been used extensively over the last 20 years to determine w/c ratio of hardened concrete. According to Round Robin tests performed in Den- mark, the expected accuracy of the method is ± 0.02 when the analysis is performed by an experienced microscopist (Jakobsen et al., 1995). A drawback of the method is that the analysis include the personal judgment of the microscopist, who estimates as best he can, in comparison with reference samples, the w/c ratio of the microstruc- ture under investigation. This aspect together with the observation that the determined water-cement ratio came often back as a range rather than a fixed number may well have resulted in the very limited use of the technique for w/c ratio determination in other countries around the world. It is here that the story also may have reached its own tail. As the w/c ratio has obtained a high com- mon practice for the compressive strength, deter- mining the w/c ratio back through the microstruc- ture of a concrete expects again a high precision in the determination of the w/c ratio, as they are considered to be linked directly together. As the determination of the w/c ratio does not provide the accurate number that is expected, there must be something wrong with the method, forgetting in the process that one w/c ratio does not provide one strength, but a range of strengths, which is reflected in itself by a range of microstructures. Hopefully this article will bring back some nuance and under- standing in this relationship between w/c ratio and strength. IV. Representative volume When a microscopy technique is involved, at some point the discussion need to touch upon the subject of representative volume. Through the very basic of the procedure of using a microscope one zooms in on the details. But at what point has the magni- fication become too large and are the details that are being looked at not representative any more for the whole structure? This dilemma is addressed through the topic of representative volume. A material microstructure can always be consid- ered as a repeating system. As long as the smaller volume through repetition can recreate the original larger microstructure, the representative volume is still there and can be used to say something about the complete microstructure. For concrete under a microscope this system of repeated representative volumes could break down rather quickly when concrete is made with larger aggregates in the order of 32 mm or above; hav- ing a thin section with an area of 50 x 30 mm is probably not representing the entire microstructure anymore. When as a rule of thumb at least three times the largest aggregate is being used to obtain a representative volume, the thin section sample size should be in the order of 100 x 100 mm. Even though at TNO it is possible to produce such large thin sections, it is expensive and not very practical. Ordinarily the microstructure of importance is the hardened cement paste, as well as the distri- bution of the smaller filler materials in interaction with the hardened cement paste. As this article fo- cuses on the water-cement ratio, the representative volume of the level of the largest aggregate is not needed. However, at the level of the hardened ce- ment paste the microstructure within a thin section of 50 x 30 mm is generally well within the necessary representative volume. Next step is to determine what at that micro- scopic level is the required representative volume. This turns out to be a bit of a chicken and the egg story. When the microstructure is very homoge- neous, larger magnifications are possible before the image in the microscope is not representative for the generalized microstructure anymore. At that time two choices can be made. First and most easy choice is to zoom out; go to lower magnifications until the representative vol- ume is restored. However, this approach loses de- tails observed at higher magnifications. Therefore, the second approach is also used a lot. This consists of collecting more image information through mul- tiple images. Ordinarily this was done by moving the sample around and try to mentally summarize the different field of views. Nowadays, the more chosen approach especially when quantifying pa- rameters is to take multiple images and average through image analysis software and procedures. In this article the road of taking multiple images has been followed. V. w/c ratio determination At TNO w/c ratio determination is performed rou- tinely by our microscopists in the way described by NT Build 361 (NT Build 361 (Nordtest 1991-02), 1991). However, as a side research line over the past years procedures have been developed to determine the w/c ratio of concrete through the use of image analysis techniques. On this path we have not been the first to try so. For example Jakobsen et al. (Jakobsen et al., 1995) and Elsen et al. (Elsen et al., 1995) have tried and reported on these techniques already in the nineties of last century. A combination of camera resolution, computer possibilities and image analy- sis software may have resulted in a resting state of the developments possible in this area. TNO gained renew interest in the topic around 2008. We have reported on our findings regularly in the conference series of EMABM with articles in 2009 (Einarsson et al., 2009) and in 2011 (de Rooij 263 de Rooij & Mendonça Filho Figure 6: Same location of a concrete thin section observed under two different light modes: (A) normal light mode; (B) ultra violet light mode. et al., 2011). This article follows up on the line reported in these two articles. For details on the technique please see the mentioned articles. Fur- thermore, publications to describe the entire pro- cedure are in preparation for journal publication. Here only a short highlight of the used principles are given. The backbone of the NT Build standard is pre- sented in Figure 5. A concrete sample is prepared into a thin section, which is thin enough to look through. Normally thin sections are 25 - 30 µm thick, sometimes thinner. In the process an epoxy is used to stabilize the porous and brittle microstruc- ture of concrete at these fragile scales. The epoxy enters the sample through a vacuum impregnation process causing it to settle at the dried pores of the capillary pore system. The epoxy contains a yellow dye that reacts in the ultra violet light range by exciting light. With the right filters this transforms an ordinary thin section to change from a normal light image as shown in Figure 6A, to an ultra violet light image as shown in Figure 6B. An experienced microscopist can compare the general brightness of the UV-image to a set of refer- ence samples with known w/c ratios to determine the w/c ratio of an unknown sample. The tech- nique is based on the relation that a sample with a higher w/c ratio has a higher capillary porosity, which shows up as a brighter image due to the higher amount of epoxy being present. Over the last years TNO has worked consistently to improve this technique from an experienced mi- croscopist observation to a computer interpreted value with a calculated number rather than the approximate estimation of the experienced micro- scopist. In other words, we would like to take the honest but subjective interpretation of the individ- ual as much as possible out of the equation. The current article is one step further on this path. 264 VI. Should two images provide the same answer? In previous publications the technique how to de- termine a value for a water-cement ratio using com- puter analysis has already been described. It is possible. What remained is the question if two im- ages taken from the same thin section should give the same w/c ratio result? That topic is analyzed in more detail here. To obtain a reasonable answer on this question naturally the microstructure to be analyzed should be relatively homogeneous. Hence the investiga- tion was not performed on damaged samples or on concrete with placement or degradation problems. Instead the analysis were performed on the refer- ence concrete samples TNO has for its Portland cement with a known water-cement ratio. As these thin sections are made from samples with a known water-cement ratio, the first assumption is that the analysis of two spots of the hardened cement paste in the same thin section should provide the same water-cement ratio. Unfortunately, regardless of how accurate and precise we tried to perform our analysis, almost never the results were exactly the same. Naturally, as the thin section was only containing one mi- crostructure, for long we concluded that something must be wrong with our method, as we did not obtain the answer we were expecting. That is until we reached the point that no other conclusion was possible but the obvious one: it was not the method itself, but the local variation in the microstructure that we picked up. Similar to the truck mixer of concrete not produc- ing compressive strength results with all the same value, the production of reference samples did not result in an equal microstructure at all the same lo- cations. But if the microstructure is not everywhere the same, how would we know which microstruc- 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands ture would represent the actual true water-cement ratio? Again we followed the all too familiar path also used in compressive strength measurements: we need more images to be able to average towards the most probable water-cement ratio. VII. Analysis of multiple images More images, especially in the digital age is not a problem. However, it does make a difference how to analyze these images. If we have established in the previous section that it is very unlikely that two images give exactly the same result upon analysis, then the images are different. For reasoning pur- poses, let’s assume that we have taken four images. To quantify these relatively to each other we have: a dark image, a medium-dark image, a medium-light image and a light image. When all four images are analyzed we will know the exact distribution of the results. However, what would be the result if only two images are analyzed? Does this then depend completely random on which images we took first? It could be that the averaged values are on the darker side when by chance only the dark and medium-dark image are taken. It could also be that the average results are on the light side when again by chance the light and medium-light image are analyzed only. To solve this problem the research and analy- sis were set up as follows. From a thin section with a known water-cement ratio a total of 15 lo- cations of the microstructure were photographed and analyzed individually. Next, the individual re- sults were (figuratively speaking) placed in a basket. From this basket, using a computer script, 50,000 times sets of images were drawn and analyzed for mean and standard deviation. The drawing of the samples was done in such a way that once an image was analyzed in a set, it could not be redrawn and reappear again in the same set during the same drawing sequence. Thus plots were made for an- alyzing sets of 3 images, sets of 4 images, all the way up to sets of 15 images. This was done for the range of reference samples of Portland cement with different water-cement ratios. In Figure 7, as an example, the results are shown for a w/c ratio of 0.65. The results are plotted in series with different amount of images selected to be analyzed. So the series of 3 images is the result of 50,000 times drawing sets of 3 images out of the total of 15 images. From this graph it becomes clear that more images indeed do narrow down the pre- cision of the methodology. Please also note with what accuracy the water-cement ratio can be ana- lyzed using this technique; the axis representing the w/c ratio is drawn with marks of 0.01 difference. In Figure 8 the results of the different w/c sam- ples are plotted in one graph, using only three images to analyze the w/c ratio each time. As the plot shows, it is quite difficult based on such a low number of analyzes to determine the w/c ratio of the sample under investigation. There are large overlaps in the possible water-cement ratios. How- ever, turning to Figure 9, it becomes clear that an increase in the number of images provides a much more accurate reliability on the w/c ratio of the sample under investigation. Figure 9 also shows another interesting result. Even though the preparation of the reference sam- ples has been done in laboratory conditions with the utmost precaution, the variation in the final microstructure is not everywhere identical. From the distribution in the results it becomes clear that the sample with w/c ratio of 0.61 is slightly more heterogeneous than the other samples presented in the graph. This is an observation that can only be quantified in numbers through the image anal- ysis technique used here. It shows that even our preciously made reference samples show different local variation in their microstructure. VIII. How many images should we analyze? The easy answer to the question how many samples should be analyzed is: more is better. However, that is only in relation to collecting data. Equally impor- tant is the realization what is needed, or requested from the results of all the data analyses. If the re- quest is that the outcome of the analysis should be an exact w/c ratio without any distribution, than the quest to determine this has failed before it has started. The microstructure of concrete is hetero- geneous and not identical at each and every place. Because there is variation it is not possible to come up with an answer without any deviation from the mean. It is simply not present in the material. Hence, the question should be: what is being done with the result of the analysis? And how ac- curate should this result be to be useful input for further processing. Now the answer has a relation with the next step in the process. That introduces a dependency, which could lead to a more demand- ing accuracy in one case (and hence possibly more images to be analyzed), while in another case the answer could leave room for more uncertainty re- sulting in a lower number of images to be analyzed. Obviously in this process two other parameters play a very important factor: more images usually mean a higher price that needs to be paid. The other factor is the heterogeneity of the concrete it- self. A more homogeneous microstructure requires less images to be analyzed to come to a certain 265 de Rooij & Mendonça Filho Figure 7: Histogram plot of 50,000 times selecting sets of 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 or 15 images (see legend) out of a set of 15 images taken from a thin section with an original w/c ratio of 0.65 to determine the water-cement ratio. precision than a very heterogeneous microstructure with large differences in the local microstructure. To give some guidance in this process, the follow- ing comparison has been made. In the procedure described so far, random picks have been made out of a collection of 15 images per thin section sample. This provides us with a w/c ratio calculated from the average brightness value of the cement paste from the randomly picked set of specified number of images. By doing this 50,000 times a distribution in the w/c ratio is obtained. Using the standard deviation of this distribution, for instance the mean ± once the standard deviation (68% of all values) or mean ± twice the standard deviation (95% of all values) can be plotted in a graph to give an in- dication on the accuracy. This has been done in Figure 10 with the graphs labelled ’Pick’. The accu- racy with which the w/c ratio can be determined is very precise. Another option is to take just 3, 4, 5, or any of the numbers of pictures taken, and average the light in- tensities of these images. This then is being used to obtain a mean w/c ratio. In the process of obtaining an average light intensity also a standard deviation is obtained. Taking the mean brightness ± once or twice the standard deviation and using this to determine the corresponding w/c ratio provides a different way of obtaining w/c ratio distribution. These lines are marked ’All’ in Figure 10. As can be seen, using this latter method to determine the w/c ratio distribution gives a much wider range of results. Hence, to really characterize the distribution in the w/c ratio, or rather in the heterogeneity of the microstructure, the first method is strongly advised. IX. The usefulness of these analysis What can we do with all these analysis? First of all it provides us with a way to say something about Figure 8: Distribution of the w/c ratios for the samples mentioned in the legend based on analyzing only 3 images 266 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 9: Distribution of the w/c ratios for the samples mentioned in the legend based on analyzing 9 images per thin section of a specific w/c ratio mentioned in the legend the local variation in capillary porosity. Hence, all properties that are influenced by this local variation of capillary porosity can now be studied at a mi- crostructure level in more detail through the use of optical microscopy. Obviously it would be nice to be able to link the variation in strength to the variation in local microstructure. However, much more interesting would be the characterization of the local microstructure in terms of transport prop- erties. Can we relate the local variation to values and distribution of transport parameters so we can start to understand and model the ingress patterns that we see with for example Rapid Chloride Mi- gration or carbonation, see e.g. Figure 11. We know these ingress patterns are not straight lines into the material as our current models assume. However, is it possible with this new local variability to predict the local variation in ingress that we see at a higher scale. If so, then we are making progress if only by understanding that our concrete material is so much more than just a recipe with emphasis on the water-cement ratio. A possible way to do so could be by using the width of the w/c ratio distribution, or rather the variation in the capillary porosity as a measure for the variation in the ingress rate of substances. This would open up possibilities to calculate ingress based on probability distributions rather than as a pure deterministic diffusion alone. X. Conclusion This article has taken a closer look at the determina- tion of the w/c ratio through the analysis of capil- lary porosity by using image analysis. It has shown that accurate analysis does not shown identical re- sults in the w/c ratio even for standard reference samples with known w/c ratio. This is not because the techniques we use to determine the w/c ratios Figure 10: Plot to indicate the possible accuracy for determining w/c ratio. The lines marked ’All’ are based on just averaging over the collected images. The lines marked ’Pick’ use a random picking of the indicated number of pictures out of a set of 15 images for 50,000 times. 267 de Rooij & Mendonça Filho References Figure 11: Ingress pattern of chlorides into a concrete sample after a Rapid Chloride Migration test are not accurate enough, but much more because of the local variation in the microstructure. For the first time the attention has shifted through this article from the analysis technique we use to what we actually observe in the microstructure. Hopefully this change in thought about the dis- tribution in local microstructure variation will help to set off more research towards the capturing and modelling of these microstructure variation into consequences at a more structural level. 268 Abrams, D.

N. Yio ⇤ , Hong S. Wong and Nick R. Buenfeld Concrete Durability Group, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College London, SW72AZ ⇤ marcus.yio11@ic.ac.uk Abstract This is the first investigation into the feasibility of fluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) for real-time imaging of hydrating cementitious materials. Fluorescence LSCM allows continuous imaging of a wet sample under ambient conditions. Hence, it is potentially suitable for studying cement hydration and microstructural development of cementitious materials which are very sensitive to moisture and temperature. Four cement pastes containing fluorescein and supplementary cementitious materials were continuously observed with LSCM from 15 min after mixing up to 7 days. Results clearly show the development of amorphous and crystalline phases in originally water-filled pores. Formation of ’Hadley’ grains (hollow-shell particles) was also observed. Image analysis was performed to quantify the growth of hydration products as a function of time and results were compared with simulation data obtained from the Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory. The strengths and limitations of fluorescence LSCM for real-time imaging of cement hydration are discussed. Keywords: Cement hydration, laser scanning confocal microscopy, concrete, real-time imaging, microstructure I. Introduction t When raw cement comes into contact with water, it undergoes flocculation, agglomeration, dissolution and eventually forms a range of hydration products. Within 24 hours, the cement-water mixture evolves into an interconnected multiphase solid that gradu- ally develops strength. The processes become more complicated when supplementary cementitious ma- terials (SCM) or other additives are involved. The hydration of cement governs not only the early age properties of concrete such as workability and set- ting, but also the development of microstructure which influences the mechanical properties and long-term durability of concrete. There are several methods to monitor the early hydration of cement. Examples include isothermal calorimetry which measures the heat of hydration (Lagier & Kurtis, 2007), X-ray diffraction (Scrivener et al., 2004), nuclear magnetic resonance (Johansson et al., 1999), and Fourier transform infrared spec- troscopy (Ylmén et al., 2009) which follow the chem- ical transformations of constituent phases at early age. In contrast, microscopy techniques enable morphological study of the evolving microstruc- ture. Environmental scanning electron microscopy is able to image hardened cement paste without the need for drying. However, continuous imag- ing at early ages is challenging due to difficulties with keeping the sample at the required relative humidity and temperature. Moreover, observation is made in the secondary electron mode and is qual- itative. A relatively new method called WETSEM enables fresh cement paste to be encapsulated in a sealed capsule and viewed continuously in the backscattered electron mode (Gallucci & Scrivener, 2007). However, problems with wall effects and growth of hydration products on the surface mem- brane of the capsule limit the extent of observation. Synchrotron transmission soft X-ray microscopy of- fers high-resolution imaging of hydration products forming on cement grains over time, but this tech- nique is limited to dilute specimens with a high water/cement ratio of 5 and very thin specimens that are less than 10 µm thick (Juenger, 2005). Fluorescence microscopy techniques are well- established and widely used in life sciences. Quanti- tative data can be derived based on the fluorescence emitted by fluorophores. One of the most com- monly used fluorescence microscopy techniques is laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). LSCM is able to perform real-time imaging at very high spatial and temporal resolutions under ambient conditions without requiring sample drying. More- over, it has the ability to perform three-dimensional imaging by means of non-intrusive optical section- ing. Examples of applications in life sciences in- 269 Yio et al.

In cement and concrete research, fluorescence LSCM has been used by the authors’ group for static 3D imaging of capillary pore structure, ’Hadley’ grains and microcracks in dried and epoxy impregnated concrete (Head & Buenfeld, 2006, Head et al., 2006). Recently, a new method that combines fluorescence LSCM with se- rial sectioning was proposed to enhance its ability to image large volumes of hardened concrete at sub-micron resolution (Yio et al., In press). Never- theless, fluorescence LSCM has never been applied to study hydrating cementitious materials. In this paper, we present an approach to continu- ously image the early age microstructural evolution in four different cementitious systems using fluo- rescence LSCM. Fluorescein was incorporated into the samples to act as tracer. Quantification of the growth rate of hydration products was performed by means of image analysis and results were com- pared with simulations.

The sensitivity of the photomultiplier tube (PMT) was set at a constant 625 V. It was found that a concentration of about 0.5 wt.% gave the maximum fluorescence intensity (Figure 1). Higher concentrations led to reduced in- tensities due to self-quenching of the fluorophores. However, when a higher laser intensity of 15% (i.e. the default setting for fluorescein) was used, all concentrations > 0.01 wt.% were able to give the maximum fluorescence intensity with no detectable variation. The effect of fluorescein on the hydration of ce- ment at 20 C was also investigated using an isother- mal conduction calorimeter (Calmetrix I-Cal 4000). CEM I pastes at a water/cement ratio of 0.5 pre- pared using aqueous solutions of four different fluorescein concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 wt. %) were tested. Results show that fluorescein concen- trations  0.1 wt.% had no influence on the heat of hydration (see Results for further details). Based on the findings above, a fluorescein concentration of 0.05 wt.% was used for the batching water through- out this study Materials Sample preparation Four different paste samples with a water/binder (w/b) ratio of 0.5 were prepared using ordinary Portland cement (CEM I), fly ash (FA), ground gran- ulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS), limestone filler (LF) and fluorescein-dyed tap water. Mix propor- tions for all samples are shown in Table 1. The Portland cement used complies with BS EN 197 1. The limestone filler had 70 wt.% CaCO 3 and a particle size distribution of > 70 wt.% passing 63 µm. The composition of the fly ash and slag used are shown in Table 2. Water-soluble fluorescein with a maximum ab- sorption wavelength and a maximum emission wavelength of 490 nm and 520 nm respectively was used. In order to establish the optimum concentra- tion of fluorescein, aqueous solutions containing 0.0005 to 5 wt.% fluorescein were prepared and mixed with a magnetic stirrer for 24 h and left at room temperature until the fluorophores dissolved completely. Droplets of the solutions were then Pastes were prepared by hand-mixing cement with fluorescein-dyed water for 2 min in a plastic cup. In the case of blended systems, SCM/fillers were pre-mixed with CEM I for 30 s before addition of 270 Table 2: Composition of fly ash and slag.

A small amount of the freshly mixed paste ( ⇠ 0.06 g) was promptly transferred onto a glass slide and mounted with a coverslip. The coverslip was gently pressed down on the slide to flatten the paste to approximately 500 µm thick. A small quan- tity of fluorescein water ( ⇠ 0.1g) was then carefully placed around the cement paste using a pipette to fill the empty space between the coverslip and glass slide. This was to prevent the paste from drying and to provide curing water. In order to minimise evaporation, a generous amount of nail polish was applied to seal the edges of the sample assembly. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the sample. Two samples containing just fluorescein water (no cement paste) were also prepared and weighed after 30 min, 24 h, 4 d and 7 d to check the effectiveness of the seal. Results show that the total mass loss at 7 d was 18.85% of the water originally- fed. By experience, paste can remain saturated for at least 4 weeks. All weighing procedures described above were performed using an analytical balance with a precision of 0.0001g. LSCM A Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscopy was used for imaging. An argon laser line of 488 nm was used to excite fluorescein and the beam splitter was configured to range from 500 nm to 600 nm to allow emitted fluorescence to be collected by the PMT. A 20 ⇥ (NA 0.5) dry objective with a spatial XY resolution of 0.39 µm was used. Images were zoomed at 3.5 ⇥ and digitised to 1024 ⇥ 1024 to give a pixel spacing of 0.216 µm. The Nyquist theorem states that the smallest feature that can be resolved is either 2.3 ⇥ the pixel size or the spatial resolu- tion of the objective, whichever is larger (Pawley, 1995). Based on this criterion, the smallest feature that could be observed here would be around 0.5 µm. The laser intensity was kept constant at 15% whilst the PMT was adjusted correspondingly to prevent oversaturation of pixels. The pinhole size was maintained at 1 Airy Unit and two-times line averaging was applied to reduce noise. Real-time imaging was performed starting from 15 min after mixing at 1 h intervals up to the age of 24 h, then every 12 h up to 48 h, and finally every 24 h up to 168 h (7 d). A total of ⇠ 990 images were captured per sample. At each time step, a 3 ⇥ 3 mosaic of 3D image stacks (9 stacks in total) with a z-step size of 0.84 µm was captured from the surface to the deepest possible plane in the sam- ple. The total scanned area was around 600 ⇥ 600 µm 2 . Following image acquisition, an image slice at ⇠ 7 µm beneath the sample surface was selected from each 3D stack for image analysis. This was to minimise any possible ’wall effects’ (see Results and Discussion sections). A pseudo flat-field filter was applied to the images to remove uneven bright- ness. Subsequently, the selected mosaic images were stitched together based on phase correlation to form a larger image. The reconstructed images were then aligned, contrast enhanced by means of histogram stretching to compensate for signal loss due to photo bleaching 1 and finally median filtered to be ready for analysis. III. Results Isothermal calorimetry Results from isothermal calorimetry up to 48 h of hydration show that the heat flow curves of CEM I pastes containing fluorescein-dyed water were simi- lar to that of the reference sample which contained CEM I and pure water (Figure 3). No shoulder was observed on any of the curves for samples contain- ing fluorescein. These observations suggest that flu- orescein does not significantly alter the cement hy- dration mechanism, within the concentration range studied. The data for sample with 0.1 wt.% fluores- cein overlapped that of the control throughout the induction, acceleration and retardation stages. This confirms that fluorescein concentrations of up to 0.1 wt.% have no influence on hydration. However, a slight delay in the acceleration period was observed at higher fluorescein concentrations. This effect was particularly apparent for the sample containing 1.0 wt.% fluorescein. 1 Photo bleaching is a photochemical process where fluo- rophores gradually lose their ability to fluoresce after being exposed to prolonged laser irradiation. 271 Yio et al. Figure 2: Schematic of sample cross section (not to scale). Observations Figure 4 shows a series of z-stack images cover- ing an imaging depth of 0.8 to 16.8 µm below the surface of the CEM I + 23% FA sample after 15 min of hydration. The images were cropped, con- verted to greyscale and inverted to highlight the features of interest. Note that dark areas represent fluorescein water-filled spaces and the bright areas correspond to solid phases. The images show that the microstructure of the first several microns below the surface is highly porous due to accumulation of water from bleeding (and possibly curing wa- ter) beneath the coverslip. Small particles, some of which were tips of larger particles from within the sample, were also observed. As the imaging depth increased, the size of the particles became larger and their shape became more defined. However, a gradual loss of signal was observed as the image plane moved further ( > 7 µm) into the sample. This was because the laser became increasingly blocked Figure 3: Heat flow and cumulative heat of CEM I pastes containing various concentrations of fluorescein. 272 by overlying particles and hence was unable to ex- cite fluorescein from deeper planes. As a result, the feature resolution degraded with depth. As mentioned in Methodology, images at ⇠ 7 µm be- neath the sample surface with no discernible signal degradation were used for image analysis. Figure 5 shows examples of areal matching im- ages from each mix captured at ⇠ 7 µm beneath the sample surface at 15 min, 12, 24 and 168 h. It is clear from the figure that all images at 15 min show particles with rather distinct shapes and boundaries. Fly ash particles can be easily distinguished based on their spherical shape. However, it is relatively more difficult to distinguish slag and limestone filler particles from cement particles. It can be observed that cement particles gradually lose their distinct boundary over time (see particle marked ’C’ in the CEM I mix in Figure 5(a) for ex- ample). This is due to dissolution of cement which releases ions into the mix water to form hydration products in water-filled spaces and topochemical reaction that results in the growth of hydration products on the surfaces of cement particles. In con- trast, SCM and limestone fillers maintained their shape throughout the imaging period (see particles marked ’L’, ’F’ and ’S’ in Figure 5(b), (c) and (d)) due to their low reactivity at early ages. The ap- pearance of hydration products in the water-filled spaces is indicated by arrows in Figure 5. It can be observed that the size and contrast of the pore spaces gradually decreases over time as they be- come filled with hydration products that resemble a network of amorphous phases. It is interesting to note that some large pores that were initially occupied by the mix water remained porous at 168 h, indicating that such pores would not be com- pletely filled with hydration products. Comparing only the images at 168 h, the CEM I mix appeared markedly denser than the blended mixes. This is in line with current understanding of the effect of SCMs on early age hydration. For example, re- 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 4: Z-stack images at 0.8 to 16.8 µm below the surface of the CEM I + 23% FA sample after 15 min of hydration. ’F’ represents fly ash. sults obtained from image analysis and the Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory (VCCTL) (Bullard et al., 2009) simulations show that the CEM I mix has the highest cumulative volume fraction of hydration products (see Image analysis). The development of ’Hadley’ grains i.e. hollow shell particles was also detectable. Figure 6 presents a sequence of images showing the evolution of a shell around a cement particle (marked ’H’) found in the CEM I mix. At 15 min, the original bound- ary of the cement particle is distinct, but after 12 h, the cement particles become increasingly engulfed with diffuse hydration products. At around 24 h, a distinct shell structure can be seen forming pref- erentially on the top of the grain, connecting with the outer hydration products. Perhaps, the hollow shell formed much earlier but was too thin (Gal- lucci et al., 2010) to be resolved by LSCM. Within the shell, needle-like hydration products that con- nect the outer products and the anhydrous core were observed. The hollow shell increased in size with time, while the anhydrous core diminished. Figure 5: Imaging results of (a) CEM I, (b) CEM I + 17% LF, (c) CEM I + 23% FA and (d) CEM I + 37.5% GGBS at 15 min, 12h, 24 h and 168 h. ’C’, ’L’, ’F’ and ’S’ represent cement, limestone filler, fly ash and slag, respectively. 273 Yio et al. Figure 6: Development of a ’Hadley’ grain particle marked ’H’ found in the CEM I system. Ultimately, the shell could become entirely hollow. Indeed, Hadley et al. (2000) and Head et al. (2006) observed completely hollow-shell grains in 28-day- old cement paste and concrete samples. The hydra- tion products that appear to have an amorphous morphology are most likely the C-S-H phase with structures beyond the resolution of LSCM. How- ever, large plate-like crystals in the size of tens of µm that are uniform and well-defined were also observed (see arrows in Figure 7). Some of these crystals exhibit fluorescence on their edges. These are portlandite crystals that are preferentially ori- ented with their C-axis perpendicular to the cov- erslip interface. Such features are similar to those reported in studies of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between cement paste and flat rock surfaces (Yuan & Odler, 1987). The time to the appearance of the first plate-like crystal was generally between 2 to 3 h for all systems. Similar observations were made by Gallucci and Scrivener (2007) using the WETSEM capsules to image the hydration of CEM I with SEM-BSE. However, in the present study, the growth of portlandite did not block or limit obser- vation because imaging was performed subsurface. This enabled observations to be made for much longer than what is possible with the WETSEM capsules. bright pixels than image I t 1 due to the growth of hydration products. Therefore, the result of sub- traction can be regarded as the growth of outer hydration products between time t and t 1. How- ever, inner hydration products that form within the original boundary of cementitious particles are ne- glected. The subtracted images are then segmented by thresholding the transition point near the higher end of the histogram to measure the growth of hy- dration products. This transition point corresponds arbitrarily to where the change in the cumulative curve is ⇠ 0.1%. Noise is removed from segmented images by means of a morphological closing oper- ation. Artefacts which may result from the move- ment of imaging plane in the z-axis when mosaic imaging is performed are reduced by discarding pixel groups containing < 10 pixels and with a cir- cularity > 0.75; these criteria were found to yield satisfactory results based on visual inspection. The image analysis procedures described above are illus- trated in Figure 8(a-e). We stress that the results are Image analysis Ideally, image segmentation would be performed directly on the reconstructed images to separate pore spaces from solids. However, this is rela- tively challenging because the grey histogram spans across the entire scale range with no distinct peaks that can be used to guide thresholding. For pre- liminary quantification, image subtraction was car- ried out on a pixel-by-pixel basis between consecu- tive area-matching images at every time step using equation (1) to quantify the growth of hydration products: DI = I t I t 1 (1) Where I t is the image captured at time t = 1, 2, 3 . . . 168 h. Image I t will always have more 274 Figure 7: Observation of plate-like portlandite crystals (marked by arrows) in the CEM I system at 18 h. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 8: Demonstration of the image analysis procedure on a large crystal found in the CEM I + 17% LF system: (a) reconstructed image at 6 h, I 6 , (b) reconstructed image at 7 h, I 7 , (c) result of the subtraction I 7 - I 6 , (d) segmented area of (c) and (e) cumulative segmented areas at 6, 12, 24 and 168 h. preliminary; research is on-going to develop a more accurate approach to quantify the microstructure. The cumulative segmented area representing the total area fraction of hydration products is plot- ted as a function of time up to 24 h in Figure 9(a) and up to 168 h in Figure 9(b). During the first 12 h, the trends for all four samples were similar although a slight acceleration was observed with those containing 17% limestone fillers and 37.5% slag. Limestone fillers are known to accelerate the hydration of cement because they provide nucle- ation sites for hydration products (Lothenbach et al., 2008). The slight acceleration observed after 4 h seems to be in agreement with the findings of Lothenbach et al. (2008). However, slag was not expected to accelerate hydration at early ages and therefore further work is needed to clarify if this observation is a real effect or due to imper- fections in the image analysis approach adopted here. After 12 h, the cumulative segmented areas for blended samples were much lower than that of the control. The disparity increased with increasing SCM/filler content. This was due to the reduced cement content and lower reactivity of the SCMs. It is also well-established that the pozzolanic reac- tion of SCMs occurs at much greater ages whereas limestone fillers are not pozzolanic. It is instructive to compare the results with mod- elling predictions. Here, the VCCTL model (Bullard et al., 2009) was used to simulate the hydration of the four systems investigated under saturated condition at 20 C. The volume fractions of outer hydration products are plotted against time in Fig- ure 9 (c) and a good qualitative agreement with our measurements (Figure 9(b)) can be seen. In line with our observations, the volume fraction of outer hydration products decreased with increasing SCM content. However, the retardation effects caused by SCM were apparent from the start of hydration. A very slight accelerating effect was also observed with the system containing 17% limestone filler but this occurred at a much later time, i.e. between 10 and 19 h. The observed differences could be due to the fact that our analyses were carried out near the surface region where the microstructure is affected by bleeding as discussed in the previous section. Clearly, this needs to be investigated further. IV. Discussion The experimental results obtained show that flu- orescence LSCM has great potential for real-time imaging of the hydration process and microstruc- ture development in cementitious materials. The main advantage of fluorescence LSCM lies in its ability to perform continuous imaging of a sample under wet conditions. Using the sample prepara- tion procedure described above, imaging of a fresh cement paste with a realistic w/b ratio of 0.5 can start as early as 15 min and can last more than 7 d until the sample begins to dry as a result of self-desiccation. LSCM is also able to perform three-dimensional imaging by means of optical sectioning to obtain 275 Yio et al. Figure 9: Cumulative segmented area of outer hydration products obtained from image analysis: (a) up to 24 h; (b) up to 168 h, (c) simulation results from the VCCTL. subsurface information. This allows imaging of in- ternal microstructural away from the surface zone. Measurement of mass of the samples before and after a routine scanning procedure showed no re- duction in mass, thus confirming that no drying occurred due to laser irradiation. Laser exposure is also not expected to generate heat that can cause localised acceleration of cement hydration since the applied intensity is low and is widely used for imaging living cells and tissues. However, the imaging depth of LSCM is lim- ited. As a result, wall effects cannot be completely eliminated. Another limitation is that only the fluorescein-filled spaces can be detected. Despite these limitations, LSCM has advantages over the WETSEM capsule which permits only surface imag- ing within a limited time of  13 h (Gallucci & Scrivener, 2007). Moreover, by means of appro- priate image processing methods such as contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) (Zuiderveld, 1994), it may be possible to select im- ages from deeper planes for analysis. Work to de- velop this aspect is on-going. 276 V. Conclusion This study has demonstrated the potential of flu- orescence LSCM for real-time imaging of hydra- tion and microstructure development of cementi- tious materials. It is shown that, unlike other tech- niques, fluorescence LSCM is capable of performing three-dimensional continuous imaging of hydrat- ing cementitious materials at sub-micron resolution under ambient conditions. This aspect is particu- larly important for studying these materials which are moisture and temperature dependent. Four cementitious systems containing various amounts of SCM/fillers were observed with LSCM from 15 min after mixing up to 7 days of hydration. Various interesting observations such as the appearance of amorphous hydration products in pores, growth of portlandite crystals and formation of ’Hadley’ grain particles were made. Results from image analysis show that the volume fraction of outer hydration products decreased with increasing SCM/filler con- tent and this was consistent with simulation data from the VCCTL. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Acknowledgement M.H.N.

Boehm-Courjault ⇤ , J.E. Rossen and K. Scrivener Laboratory of Construction Materials, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland ⇤ emmanuelle.boehm@epfl.ch Abstract The present paper aims at better understanding the mechanisms controlling the kinetics of cement hydration and of the limiting factors of the characteristic periods observed by calorimetry, slightly simplifying the problem by studying the hydration of pure C 3 S instead of real cement. During hydration, C-S-H is formed. It forms the major part of the binding phase in the cement paste. In C-S-H, the ratio between Ca and Si is not fixed and can vary according to the experimental conditions and especially the composition of the solution it is in equilibrium with. Four C 3 S pastes were produced by mixing C 3 S powder with pure water or with mixes of water and isopropanol (with isopropanol contents of 7.5, 17.5 and 25 vol%) with a constant liquid/solid ratio of 0.5. Hydration was stopped by freeze-drying at different characteristic periods of the calorimetry curves: during the induction period, at the main hydration peak and in the deceleration period at a degree of hydration of 35 %. Different techniques were used for characterising the pastes at each hydration stage: thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) in both a SEM and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). For SEM-EDX analyses, polished sections of the pastes were produced, whereas for TEM-EDX analyses, samples were thinned down to TEM lamellae by focused ion beam (FIB). In this paper, SEM and TEM images are presented, showing the fibrillar morphology of C-S-H at the different hydration stages for each paste. The Ca/Si ratio measured by TGA, SEM-EDX and TEM-EDX are presented as well. The results are in good agreement with the generally observed values. The effect of isopropanol on hydration is studied, considering the morphology and the composition of C-S-H. It is shown that it has no influence on the hydration mechanism but only on the kinetics of the reaction. Keywords: C 3 S; C-S-H; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy I. Introduction Tricalcium silicate Ca 3 SiO 5 or C 3 S is the major phase of Portland cement (PC) clinker. Most of it is impure, incorporating ions such as aluminium, magnesium or zinc and called alite. Its hydration controls the hydration of cement at early age. The reaction of C 3 S with water results in the forma- tion of both calcium hydroxide (CH or Portlandite) and a calcium silicate hydrate phase with variable composition (C-S-H), according to the following equation: C 3 S + ( 3 x n ) H 2 O ! C x S H n + ( 3 x ) CH (1) Isopropanol is an inert solvent and it is known for its weak impact on the microstructure of C-S- H. It is commonly used to stop the hydration of cement phases (Zhang and Sherer, 2011; Makar and Sato, 2013). In this study, isopropanol was chosen for replac- ing part of the water mixed with C 3 S to obtain C 3 S pastes, keeping a liquid/C 3 S ratio of 0.5. Four different compositions of isopropanol/water mixes were chosen: 0; 7.5; 17.5 and 25 vol% of isopropanol. The sample hydrated with 0% of isopropanol is used as a reference. By hydrating C 3 S with these different mixtures, the effect of isopropanol on the hydration kinectics of C 3 S is studied. The morphology and composition of C-S-H at different degrees of hydration are also investigated. As it can be seen in reaction (1), C-S-H does not exhibit a stoichiometric composition. Studies regarding the composition of this phase have given results for mean Ca/Si ratio ranging from 1.2 to 2.3 (Richardson, 1999) in C 3 S or PC pastes. Different characterisation methods can be used to determine this Ca/Si ratio, such as thermo- gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). In this study, three of them were used: TGA, EDX in a scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDX) and EDX 279 Boehm-Courjault et al. Figure 1: Calorimetry curves of the 4 pastes (a) and related DoH vs. time (b). in a transmission electron microscope (TEM-EDX), in order to compare the results at different degrees of hydration. II. Materials and methods C 3 S synthesis Pure C 3 S was synthesised by mixing three parts of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) with one part of quartz powder (SiO 2 ). Both raw materials are of high pu- rity, both supplied by Merck. The mixture was homogenized 24 hours in water and then dried at 100 C for another 24h hours. The dried material was crushed and pressed into pellets. The latter were calcined at 1650 C for 8 hours, with a heating ramp of 200 C per hour ensuring a complete de- carbonation of the raw materials. They were then quenched in air and ground for 30 seconds in a disc mill. Finally, the resulting material was tumbled in a Turbula blender for 8 hours, and then sieved to keep only the fraction smaller than 25 microns. Batches of around 350 g of C 3 S can be obtained by this technique. XRD was carried out to ensure that C 3 S is the main phase which was formed as expected, and that other phases (remaining CaCO 3 or SiO 2 , free lime. . . ) are only traces. The C 3 S batch used for the experiments described in this paper contained less than 0.5 wt% of impurities. The synthesised C 3 S is then always kept in a desiccator in order to avoid absorption of water and CO 2 from air. Isothermal calorimetry and preparation of the specimens As reaction (1) is exothermic, its kinetics can be monitored by isothermal calorimetry. A TAM Air isothermal calorimeter from Thermometric is used. Figure 1a shows the calorimetry curves of the 4 systems (0; 75; 175; 250) with a liquid/C 3 S ratio of 0.5. At first, C 3 S is dissolved very rapidly (some min- utes). Then there is a sudden slowdown in the reaction, followed by a period of low chemical ac- tivity. It is called the induction period and it is very short for our C 3 S batch (some minutes) because the particles are small ( < 25 µm). Thirdly, the main hydration peak occurs, due to the precipitation of both C-S-H and CH: this is the acceleration peak. Then there is a second deceleration, with a long period of low chemical activity (some days). It is called the deceleration period. The degree of hydration (DoH) of the reaction (1) vs. time can be calculated from the calorimetry curve, knowing the theoretical enthalpy of hydra- tion of C 3 S (517 J/g, (Taylor, 1997)). Figure 1b shows the calculated DoH of the 4 pastes vs. time. Table 1: Hydration times for the 4 pastes, depending on the chosen period of the calorimetry curve.

It is caused by the amount of available water for C 3 S to hydrate, but this is not the only explanation. The deceleration is more pronounced than for C 3 S hydrated with the same amount of water, without isopropanol. For example, for 7.5 % of isopropanol, the effective water to C 3 S ratio (w/C) is 0.4625. Figure 2 compares the calorimetry curves of the 7.5 %-sample and a C 3 S paste with a w/C of 0.4625. In presence of isopropanol the induction period is shifted in time, the main hydration peak occurs later and its height is smaller. It suggests that there is another factor influencing the kinetics of the hy- dration when isopropanol is used. Mixing water and isopropanol generates electrostatic interactions in the liquid and results in a decrease of the "reac- tivity" of water. C-S-H is formed but the kinetics of this reaction is slowered. It is not currently under- stood why this occurs. Hydration was stopped at different times by freeze-drying; this method is chosen rather than sol- vent exchange with isopropanol in order to avoid introducing isopropanol in the system as the hydra- tion mixes already contain some. At the desired time, the paste was immersed into liquid nitrogen (77 K) for 10 to 15 minutes. After freezing, it was evacuated in a freeze-dryer at low temperature (223 K) and pressure (6 Pa), for at least 24 hours. It was then stored in a desiccator for at least 2 days before doing the first measurements. Hydration times were defined using the calorime- try curves for each content of isopropanol. Hydra- tion was stopped within the induction period, at the acceleration peak and in the deceleration period at a constant DoH of 35 %. The hydration times are summarised in Table 1, while the labels of the corresponding samples are given in Table 2. Characterisation techniques Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) The amounts of C-S-H and CH formed at a given hydration time were measured by TGA on a Met- tler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e device. 50 mg of each dried sample were introduced in an alumina cru- cible. It was then heated at 900 C with a 10 C/min ramp under a 30 ml/min nitrogen flux.

Combining this data with the DoH determined by calorimetry permits the calculation of the Ca/Si ratio in the C-S-H gel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) Two different imaging modes were used in the SEM, with two different devices. The Secondary Electrons (SE) mode was useful to determine the morphol- ogy of the C-S-H. This was done with a FEI Sirion SFEG microscope equipped with an in-lens ultra- high resolution detector (it will be referred to as HR-SEM technique in the text), using low acceler- ating voltages (1-2 kV). A very small quantity of powder was dispersed on a carbon tape. A car- bon layer of approximately 15 nm was deposited on top with a Cressington carbon coater to ensure electrical conductivity in the SEM. Backscattered electrons (BSE) were also used to characterise the microstructure of polished sections. A FEI Quanta 200 microscope was used, with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Samples are embed- ded in an epoxy resin and polished until 1-micron diamond grade. They are coated with a Ballec CED 030 carbon coater. This analysis can only be done for samples with a rather high DoH ( > 35 %), as for lower ones, the samples are not hard enough to be polished. X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) was also carried out in the FEI Quanta 200 (with a Bruker XFlash EDX detector) on polished sections, in order to measure the chemical content of Ca and Si in the C-S-H of the 4 pastes with DoH = 35 %. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) A lot of techniques can be used in a TEM, because of the wide range of detectable signals. The re- sults described in this paper are recorded with the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode: the electron probe is focused into a small probe and scanned over the sample. The generated signal is detected at any point of the specimen. Two different detectors were used: bright field (BF) and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) ones. X- ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDX) was 281 thinning by FIB.

For all the TEM anal- yses, a FEI Tecnai Osiris microscope was used, oper- ating at 80 kV and at low current, these parameters aiming at not degrading the sample and preserv- ing the C-S-H microstructure.

In images (c) and (d), two different morphologies can be distinguished: near the C 3 S grains, C-S-H appears to be denser than at the surface. Accord- ing to the theory of Bazzoni, 2014), as images were taken in the deceleration period, C-S-H fibrils can- not form anymore as the surface of C 3 S grains was already completely covered.

Thus Ca and Si contents may be under- or overestimated if what is really measured is the com- position of a mixture of C-S-H with C 3 S and/or CH, which could explain the high standard deviation on SEM-EDX measurements. This intermixing of phases could normally be avoided by using TEM, as the precise area of the EDX measurement can be much more controlled (due to the sample thickness). Nevertheless the Ca/Si ratios obtained by TEM-EDX for the 175- 66h and 250-144h samples are even higher than the SEM-EDX ones. At the moment, the authors have no explanation about this fact. Further tests are still in progress. The Ca/Si ratios obtained for different samples and with different characterisation techniques are summarised in Table 4.

However, cementitious materials made from slag-rich cement, particularly CEM III /B, are very susceptible to carbonation. Recent investigations have shown that the surface application of aqueous sodium monofluorophosphate (Na-MFP) as pre- and post-carbonation treatment can improve the surface durability of cementitious materials with a high BFS content. Significant improvements have been observed in the micro-mechanical characteristics of concrete surface and frost salt scaling resistance. On the basis of previous studies we are investigating self-healing of blast furnace slag cement (BFSC) products treated with the inorganic self-healing agent Na-MFP from a mineralogical point of view. In this study we combine results of pore solution pH analyses and main element composition under the influence of Na-MFP with the presence of crystalline phases found in the solid aliquot of the samples. Pore solutions were investigated by inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Solid-material investigation was performed by X-ray powder diffractometry, including Rietveld quantitative phase analyses. Our results show that the element concentration and the pH of the paste pore solutions have direct influence on the formation of crystalline and amorphous phases forming in the solid sample aliquot during carbonation and self-healing by Na-MFP. In this work we focus especially on the influence of sulfur in solution and the formation of ettringite. In addition we discuss, why the formation of the crystalline phosphate apatite does not occur in cementitious products after Na-MFP treatment. Keywords: blast furnace slag cement, sodium monofluororphosphate, X-ray diffractometry, amorphous calcium phos- phates I. Introduction Sodium monofluorophosphate, also known as Na- MFP (chemically Na 2 PO 3 F) has previously been used as an inorganic corrosion inhibitor for steel re- inforced concrete structures (e.g. Alonso et al. 1996). Over the past decade, Na-MFP has gained interest as an inorganic self-healing agent on cementitious products rich in blast furnace slag. BFSC is an important product of the cement in- dustry in Northern European countries. In the Netherlands it holds a market share of about 60% and besides many technical advantages it is an environmentally friendly product. However, its carbonation rate is a huge drawback compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) performances and requires a large-scale industrial and feasible solu- tion to keep BFSC equally attractive for the building industry. Taylor (1997) explained the mechanisms of the poor carbonation resistance by shrinkage of the cement matrix, which occurs during the car- bonation of a hydrated BFSC product. Due to the loss of chemically-bound water during carbonation, the matrix shrinkage induces micro-cracking. Pro- gressing attack through environmental impact and seasonal temperature variations lead to large-scale surface damage in BFSC products and influences their life-time durability significantly. In order to avoid this specific damage, recent experimental studies revealed the recovering effect of Na-MFP on the microstructure of carbonated BFSC pastes with respect to their frost-salt scaling durability (Çopuroğlu et al. 2006; Sisomphon et al. 2009; 2010a, 2010b). On the basis of preliminary 287 Kempl & Çopuroğlu results, further research about the compatibility of Na-MFP for the self-healing materials concept is developed at present and adjusted to the specific slag-bearing cement type CEM III /B. In this experimental study we are investigating the influence of cementitious pore solutions to the formation of crystalline and amorphous phases. Blast furnace slag cement pastes, particularly made of CEM III /B, were impregnated with a 45 wt% aqueous solution of Na-MFP under vacuum condi- tions. Pore solutions were extracted with a high- pressure apparatus previously described by Barney- back & Diamond (1981) or Byfors et al. (1986). Sub- sequently pore solutions and paste powders were prepared for OES-ICP and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). II. Experiments Cement paste specimens were prepared from CEM III /B (42.5N HSR LH) with a BFS content of 67 wt%; and for reference purposes from CEM I (32.5 R). Both cement types were produced by the Dutch cement manufacturer ENCI and processed accord- ing to previous experimental studies (Sisomphon et al. 2009, 2010a, 2010b). The water-cement-ratio (W/C) was chosen to be 0.45. For paste preparation common tap water was used for mixing in a com- mercial Hobart mixer with one minute low-speed and one minute high-speed mixing. Specimens were cast in commercial polyethylene jars. A de- tailed working scheme is shown in Figure 1. All pastes were cured in the fog room at 100% relative humidity (RH) for 28 days after demolding from the polyethylene jars after 24 hours. Subsequently the samples were sawn in slices of 1 cm thickness in order to ensure complete chemical reaction during the different cycles of chemical treatment. For carbonation sample aliquots were exposed to a 3% CO 2 and a 75% RH atmosphere. For the Na-MFP treatment solutions of Na-MFP were pre- pared from tap water with 45 wt% Na 2 FPO 3 . The paste samples were vacuum impregnated with the respective solution either before or after carbona- tion. Chemical reaction times of 28 days were given to the specimens after Na-MFP treatment or carbon- ation, respectively. Between the treatments samples were stored in an oxygen free atmosphere at room temperature conditions in a 55% RH desiccator. For every chemical treatment a reference sample was stored in the desiccator during the whole study. This results in reference sample materials of an ordinarily hydrated CEM III /B paste, a carbonated CEM III /B paste and a CEM III /B paste vacuum impregnated with the Na-MFP self-healing agent. The hydrated CEM I paste specimen is added to the present dataset for analytical comparison of the X-ray refinements. A sample list with specific steps 288 of chemical treatment is given in Table 1. Pore solutions of all samples were gained by the application of a high-pressure apparatus and a pres- sure load of up to 500 tons for each paste specimen. The TU Delft CiTG block tester (MacBen-type) with an oil-hydraulic end-load capacity of 5000 kN was used to insert a steel-cylinder assembly with an inner diameter of 34 mm and a height of 115 mm exactly fitting the size of the paste cylinders pre- pared in the polyethylene jars. The steel cylinder assembly was build in-house from the noble-steel type 34CrNiMo6 with a maximum tensile strength of 1400 N/mm 2 to avoid high-pressure phase tran- sitions of the steel during exposure of the material to high pressures. The experimental set up was adapted from Barneyback & Diamond (1981). From all paste samples a powder aliquot of five gram was taken and finely ground under ethanol in an agate mortar down to a finish of 5 µm. Samples were prepared as dry powders for X-ray powder diffraction on an aluminum sample holder. III. Analyses In this study the pH was analyzed with a “827 pH lab” pH meter of the Metronohm AG, Switzerland. The pH meter was calibrated with Metronohm pH buffer solutions of pH 4 and 9 at 25 C prior to the analyses. The main element concentrations of the pore so- lutions were analyzed with a VARIAN Vista 720 ICP-OES. The instrument was calibrated with a 1% v/v HNO 3 blank solution and differently concen- trated solutions of the commercial multi-element standard for main elements, trace elements and rare earth elements (111355 Merck IV). All samples, the standard and the procedural blanks were ana- lyzed in 1% v/v HNO 3 . The detection limit of the analyzed elements was below or equal to 200 ppb. XRPD was performed on a Philips PW 1830/40 powder diffractometer in the micromechanical labo- ratory (Microlab) of Delft University of Technology (TUD). The machine is operated with an acceler- ating voltage of 40 kV and an X-ray beam current of 30 mA. The X-ray source is a Cu-tube working with characteristic CuKa wavelength of 0.15418 nm. The machine is equipped with a Ni-filter. Analyses were performed in air on hydrated, carbonated and on Na-MFP treated and finely ground paste pow- ders with a stepsize of 0.02 for a 2q angle range between 5 and 70 . Every step was analysed for 10 seconds. A total number of 3099 data points per sam- ple could be used for quantitative phase analy- ses performed by the Rietveld-refinement method with the GSAS software package. For the Rietveld- refinement an eight-term Chebeyshev polynomial model was used.

For the iden- tification of the C(A)SH phases, several different C(A)SH polymorphs (hillebrandite, afwillite, 14-Å- tobermorite and hydrogarnet) were used for the refinement. The polymorphs vary in their Ca:Si ratio or their water concentration, or both. C(A)SH polymorphs were primarily chosen on the basis of their peak occurrence. Due to their partly poor crystallinity and often low intensity, and due to their overlapping diffraction bands in the XRD pat- terns the C(A)SH phases were secondarily chosen after their Ca:Si ratio and their water concentrations as Ca and Si are to different amounts available for C(A)SH formation in each cement type. The refined phase specific parameters of the distinct crystalline and major phases were the lattice pa- rameters, the peak profile parameters and the scale factors. Due to the high amount of amorphous phases in the BFS pastes, but also to the high band of bremstrahlung in the diffractograms between 5 and 20 2q (Figure 3) the occupancy factors of the ions in the solid solution series were not refined. In order to model the peak shape and the variation of the peak shift for distinct and major criystalline phases the pseudo-voigt function was chosen. The pseudo-voigt Lorentzian-Gaussian mixing parame- ter was refined and peak assymetry correction was also performed, again only for distinct and ma- jor crystalline phases. Finally, spherical harmonic preferential orientation corrections were applied for cylindric and platy mineral phases (portlandite, ettringite, C 3 S and partially C 2 S). To avoid exces- sive deviations, constraints were put on the lattice parameters and the profile fitting parameters with a 2% allowance for the deviation from literature values for the lattice parameters. IV. Results and Discussion Analyses of pH and main elements The pH of all cement paste pore solutions is listed in Table 3. As expected, the hydrated cement pastes have a very basic character with a pH of 13.1 for CEM I and 13.0 for CEM III /B. The carbonated CEM III /B paste pore solution has a pH of 8.8. These results are in good agreement with the com- monly analyzed pH values of ⇠ 13 for hydrated ce- ment pastes and 8-9 for carbonated cement pastes (e.g. Taylor, 1997). If an aqueous solution of 45 wt% Na-MFP is added to the CEM III /B paste via vacuum impregnation, the pH of the pore solution is increasing to a pH of 13.1 (Table 3).

The CEM III /B paste that was first carbonated and subsequently impregnated with the Na-MFP solution has a pH of 11.7. This shows that the treatment of a slag-rich carbonated cement paste with a 45 wt% solution of Na-MFP has the potential to recover the pH of a hydrated CEM III /B with up to 90% in a chemical reaction time of 28 days. The results of the main element analyses are also listed in Table 3. In order to illustrate the percent- age of main element concentrations in the slag-rich cement pastes, the relative main element concen- trations are shown in pie diagrams in Figure 2. In the pore solution of a hydrated CEM I (CEM I-01) paste the alkali elements Na + and K + make up the highest concentration with 44.6wt.% and 52.2wt.%, respectively and stabilize the very basic pH, while Mg 2 + , Ca 2 + , S 4 + and the trace elements (Li, Ba, Sr, Fe, Al and Si) comprise a total of 3.2%. The high amount of alkali elements has previously also been observed by Song & Jennings (1999) and Brouwers & van Eijk (2003). A similar result was analysed in the hydrated CEM III /B (CEM III-01) paste in which Na + makes up about 48.5% and K + makes up 46.3% of the main elements in the pore solu- tion. The remaining 5.2% consist of Mg 2 + , Ca 2 + , S 4 + and the trace elements. In CEM I pastes as well as in CEM III /B pastes the high pH is controlled by the high concentrations of alkali elements (Song & Jennings, 1999; Brouwers & van Eijk, 2003). The increase of S 4 + in the pore solution of a slag-rich cement paste compared to the pore solution of a hydrated CEM I paste can be explained by the pres- ence of BFS containing an additional amount of 290 abbrev. S 4 + . The main element concentrations in a slag-rich cement paste change drastically after carbonation (CEM III-02); especially the concentration of S 4 + is increasing remarkably with up to 53.6% in the pore solution. Also Ca 2 + (28.2%) and Mg 2 + (13.1%) are increasing in the pore solution of a carbonated CEM III /B paste, while Na + , K + and the trace elements can be summed up to 5.1%. If a hydrated CEM III /B paste is impregnated with a 45 wt% solution of Na-MFP (CEM III-06), an increase of Na + (65.1%) must be obvious. Relative to Na + , K + makes up about 23.7%, while Mg 2 + , Ca 2 + , S 4 + and the trace elements result in a total percentage of 11.3% and seem to be getting activated by Na-MFP. Again, ex- pecially S 4 + is remarkably increasing in the pore solution. Finally, the Na + concentration in a carbon- ated CEM III /B paste impregnated with Na-MFP solution (CEM III-08) increases up to 57.1%. While K + , Mg 2 + , Ca 2 + and the trace elements make up 2.4%, S 4 + is again present as a major element with up to 39.8%. The relatively high concentrations of the main elements in the two CEM III /B cement pastes (Ta- ble 3) treated with Na-MFP solutions are mainly caused by the Al 3 + and Fe 3 + /2 + , likely being acti- vated with the addition of Na-MFP. X-ray powder diffraction and quantitative phase analyses by Rietveld-refinement Prior to the quantitative phase analyses occurring crystalline phases were identified. The x-ray diffrac- tograms of all samples are shown in Figure 3. The diffraction pattern of hydrated CEM I paste was 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 2: Main element concentrations of slag-rich cement paste pore solutions in percent; upper left: hydrated CEM III /B; upper right: hydrated and carbonated CEM III /B; lower left: Na-MFP impregnated CEM III /B and lower right: carbonated and Na-MFP impregnated CEM III /B. primarily added for reference purposes. Distinct peaks of crystalline phases such as portlandite, et- tringite and alite could clearly be identified and were used for further preliminary peak identifica- tion in the slag-rich cement paste diffractograms. Less distinct peaks of belite could also be found, but were partly overlapped by alite (Taylor, 1997), which can form solid solutions with Mg 2 + , Al 3 + , P 4 + , Fe 2 + and Si 4 + (Nishi et al. 1984). Due to their poor crystallinity, but also to their complex solid solution formation with alkali elements and the occurrence of numerous polymorphs and vary- ing water concentrations, the C(A)SH phases could not clearly be identified. The primarily amorphous character of these phases also causes a relatively large background and a diffuse diffraction band between 25 and 40 2q. However the refinement was performed with afwillite and 14-Å tobermorite, of which afwillite was found to be the major CSH- phase, while tobermorite was quantified with an amount of less than 2 wt%, which is below the ac- tual detection limit of the method. The results of the quantitative analyses are listed in Table 4. X-ray diffraction patterns of slag-rich cement pastes generally show a diffuse, asymmetric band from the amorphous blast furnace slag ranging from 20 to 48 2q and peaking at about 31 2q (Regourd, 1986). In addition the diffuse band of the poorly cristalline to amorphous CSH phases is un- derlying the amorphous BFS band in the diffraction pattern in Figure 3. This even increases the back- ground of the diffraction patterns for the slag-rich cement pastes. However in a hydrated CEM III /B (CEM III-01) Table 3: pH values and main element concentrations of the pore solutions gained from high-pressure pore solution expression.

Wider peaks of alite (31 -33 2q), and a diffuse mixture of portlandite and ettringite bands (27 -29 2q) could be observed and were used for the quantitative phase analyses. The amount of portlandite quantified in CEM III /B is approximately three times lower than the amount of portlandite in the comparable CEM I paste (Ta- ble 4). This is in good agreement with the starting composition of the cement types: blast furnace slag cement contains about 67 wt% BFS and therefore roughly one-third less clinker. Consequently, only about one-third of CaO can undergo hydration dur- ing paste manufacturing and curing in CEM III /B. The analyses of the slag-rich cement paste resulted in a relatively high concentration of alite (71.3 wt%). Though a higher amount of alite could be expected in slag-rich cement pastes, due to the higher con- centration of Si in the BFS, this value is unusally high. It might be caused during the refinement as a consequence of overlapping peaks with belite or the large peak width on top of the amorphous CSH fraction of the sample. The latter has likely happened since it is visible in the relatively low amount of quantified crystalline CSH phases (Table 4). CEM III /B has a much larger chemical variabil- ity due to the addition of BFS, which generally has a melilitic composition. As a result the formation of portlandite solid solition e.g. with the isostructural brucite (mineralogically Mg(OH) 2 ) and additional dipositive ions would be expected (Taylor, 1997 and references therein). In addition, the poorly crys- talline CSH phases can substitute a couple of ions. In a gel or amorphous phase these ions can even multiple-positively be charged. In general this in- cludes minor amounts of Al 3 + , Fe 3 + /2 + , Al 3 + , Si 4 + , K + , Na + , but it can also comprise ions such as P 4 + (Taylor, 1997). The non-stoichiometric amorphous amount of phases existing in the samples surely tamper with the phase quantification. With the addition of aqueous Na-MFP to a hy- drated slag-rich cement paste (CEM III-06) the et- tringite peaks show a slightly higher intensity com- pared to the hydrated CEM III /B paste. The quan- titative analyses resulted in 15 ( ± 2) wt% ettrinigite compared to the hydrated slag-rich cement paste. The amount of portlandite in CEM III-06 is given with 9 wt%, which scatters within the common standard deviation of ± 2 wt% for each clearly crys- talline quantified phase. Compared to the hydrated slag cement paste the amount of portlandite is not significantly varying.

Some crystalline phases, such as portlandite, ettrinigite, alite, vaterite, calcite and aragonite show distinct peak positions, whereas poorly cristalline phases, amorphous phases or phases with a lower quantity cause a rather high background or broad peaks, respectively.(see Table 2 for mineral abbreviations). 292 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Table 4: Results of the quantitative phase analyses by Rietveld-refinement.

These phases were chosen due to there smaller Ca:Si ratio in comparison to afwillite and due to their better compatibility in the course of the re- finement. Again the C(A)SH phases can substitute numerous positively charged ions in the form of a non-stoichiometric gel. After carbonation of a hydrated CEM III /B paste (CEM III-02), the distinct peaks of portlandite dis- appear almost completely (Figure 3). The amount of portlandite quantified in this sample is 3 ( ± 2) wt% (Table 4). Also the intensity of the ettringite peaks is clearly decreased after carbonation. The quantified crystalline amount in this sample is 7 ( ± 2) wt%. Instead of distinct ettringite and port- landite peaks, large amounts of vaterite, aragonite and calcite were identified (Table 4) amongst the crystalline fraction of the sample. This is in good agreement with the observations by Brocken & Nij- land (2004), who assume the formation of vaterite after the interaction of carbon dioxide with ettrin- gite during carbonation. Crystalline CSH phases have not been detected and the diffuse band of CSH phases seems to be decreased in the diffraction pat- tern of CEM III-02. Greenberg & Chang (1965) found CSH phases to be instable at pH values be- low 9.5. This finding would be in good agreement with the absence of CSH phases in the diffraction pattern and the analysed pH of 8.8 (Table 3). Alite and belite do not seem to be significantly influenced by the rather short time period of hydration and carbonation given to the sample in this study. CEM III-08 was first carbonated and subsequently 7 18 15 13 10 36 impregnated with aqueous Na-MFP. The diffraction pattern shows a recovery of portlandite from 3 ( ± 2) wt% in the carboanted cement paste to 7 ( ± 2) wt% in the sample that was first carbonated and subse- quently impregnated with Na-MFP. It also shows a decent re-occurence of the ettringite peaks, quan- tified with about 15 ( ± 2) wt% of the crystalline fraction of the samples and a re-occurrence of the diffuse diffraction band of the CSH phases (36 ( ± 2) wt%) after the recovery of the pH up to 11.7 (Table 3). The dominant CSH phase chosen for the re- finement was 14-Å tobermorite. The clinker crystal alite seems to be stable during the whole carbon- ation and Na-MFP impregnation process within the investigated sample age, while belite could not be identified in this sample. Instead a decent to- tal percentage of carbonates of 23 ( ± 2) wt% is still present. Rietveld-refinement and its challenges to cement product analyses The Rietveld-refinement method generally allows quantitative phase anlayses of crystalline materials. Thanks to the development of high-performance X-ray powder diffractometers and detectors as well as stable-functioning software, improved sample preparation techniques and analyses, the Rietveld refinement has become a common tool in the ce- ment, cement clinker and cement product charac- terization. However, a Rietveld refinement has not become a trivial analysis. Specific issues of quanti- fying hydrated cement phases are the occurrence of numerous poorly crystalline or even amorphous phases such as CSH phases. Some of them are 293 Kempl & Çopuroğlu only present in minor amounts of less than 2 wt%; which is just the detection limit for a crystalline phase in a good quality refinement. Additionally the occurrence of overlapping diffraction peaks, as well as the common paragenesis of solid solution se- ries and polymorphs of occurring hydrated cement phases as well as the occurrence of other amor- phous supplementary cementitious materials such as BFS, influence the statistical quality parameters of a refinement on cementitious composites. In the refinement presented in this study the DWD and c 2 of each analyses did not reach the necessary values to speak about a 90% certainty for phase quantification (Table 4). This is mainly due to the amounts of amorphous BFS and the formation of poorly crystalline C(A)SH phases, increasing the background of the analyses. In addition the Philips pw 1830/40 is a relatively old machine showing the large band of bremsstrahlung between 5 and 20 2q in the diffractograms (Figure 3). After the analy- ses of a 98% crystalline quartz standard, the same band has been observed and could be excluded to be purely caused by the presence of amorphous phases. Due to the available equipment and filters we consciously disclaimed the refinement of the occu- pancy factors of the ions in the occurring solution series and the subtraction of the amorphous phases as suggested by Snellings et al. (2014a; 2014b). In addition, the diffraction patterns show numerous spurious peaks originating from the tungsten of the old X-ray tube that also influences the statistical parameters of the quantitative phases analyses. In this context it should be mentioned that our results “only” show the crystalline phases included in the analyses and that the sums are normalized up to the phase contents of 100% as usually performed by the refinements. That means that only relative proportions of the crystalline phases are obtained, while the amorphous fraction of the samples should better be identified by e.g. electron-microscopy and image analysis. based on results of experimental work that have shown that the crystalline calcium phosphate with the mineral formula Ca 5 (PO 4 ) 3 (OH/F/Cl) can form from portlandite and Na-MFP in aqueous solutions of different pH values (Farcas et al. 2006, Basti- das et al. 2010). Yet, the formation of apatite af- ter Na-MFP treatment of BFSC products has never been observed (Sisomphon et al. 2011; Douche- Portanguen et al. 2005) and could also not be jus- tified by thermodynamic calculations (Bastidas et al. 2010). Although the occurrence of apatite-like structures was earlier detected in calcium alumi- nate cements by Pöllmann (2012), neither hydroxyl- nor fluoroapatite could ever be identified in cemen- titious products treated with Na-MFP (Alonso et al. 1996; Çopuroğlu et al. 2006; Söylev & Richard- son, 2008; Douche-Portanguen et al. 2005). In- stead, the interaction of hardened cement paste with Na-MFP in solution resulted in the forma- tion of portlandite, carbonates and a paragenisis with clinker minerals (Douche-Portanguen et al. 2005) and non-stoichiometric amorphous calcium phosphates (Çopuroğlu et al. 2006) or traces of FePO 4 ·H 2 O (Alonso et al. 1996; Söylev & Richard- son, 2008) in the environment of steel reinforce- ments. Boskey and Posner (1974) experimentally investi- gated the conversion of Amorphous Calcium Phos- phate (ACP) to hydroxyl-apatite in the presence of magnesium and found very low concentrations of magnesium already influencing the amorphization of apatite. The concentrations of Mg 2 + presented in Table 3 are sufficient to prevent the formation of crystalline apatite in cementitious products. The re- sults of the X-ray powder diffraction analyses also confirm that no crystalline phosphate mineral is formed during Na-MFP treatment of portlandite- bearing cementitious products – at least not within the age and time range of sample investigation. The concentration of magnesium in pore solution and the presence of apatite The results of the main element analyses (Table 3) show that S 4 + in a carbonated slag-rich cement paste pore solution is increasing to an amount of 3.5 g/l compared to the non-carbonated slag-cement paste. Correlating this result with the result of the crystalline phase analyses (Table 4) we observe the amount of the crystalline sulfur-bearing mineral et- tringite, as formed during cement hydration, to be decreasing by progressing carbonation. That way S 4 + can be released to the pore solution. Brocken & Nijland (2004) assume that during carbonation vaterite and possibly other carbonates are forming from ettringite and carbon dioxide, but do not dis- cuss to where sulfur could partition. Though S 4 + can be bound to amorphous hydration products The acidic character and composition of a cementi- tious paste pore solution has a strong influence on the stabilization or destabilization of crystalline and amorphous phases. In this context hydration and carbonation processes of numerous cement types have intensively been studied (e.g. Hong & Glasser, 2002; Bullard et al. 2011). Yet, several studies have controversially dis- cussed the formation of apatite (Çopuroğlu et al. 2006; Zemskov S.V. et al. 2012; Söylev & Richard- son, 2008; Douche-Portanguen et al. 2005; Farcas et al. 2002; Bastidas et al. 2010; Tadic et al. 2002), 294 Sulfur in pore solution, carbonation and the sta- bility of ettringite 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands (C(A)SH phases) in cement pastes, the amount of S 4 + in the pore solution of the carbonated slag- cement paste is significantly high. This again can be explained by the pH of a carbonated paste (in this case 8.8) and the fact that only at pH values higher than 9.5 the C(A)SH phases are stable. The high sulfur concentration in the pore solution of a carbonated CEM III /B paste is a result of ettringite dissolution. Brocken & Nijland (2004) show an SEM photomi- crograph, illustrating the formation of ettringite needles that preferably occur at the interface be- tween pore paste surface and paste matrix. If et- tringite breaks down during carbonation, sulfur is increasing especially in the pore solutions. V. Conclusion Through the application of aqueous Na-MFP as a self-healing agent on CEM III /B this study shows that Na-MFP has the potential to recover the pH of a carbonated cement paste up to 90% with an Na-MFP concentration of 45 wt% in the healing agent. Parallel to our solid-phase analytical results we show that during carbonation of a slag-rich cement paste phase transitions from portlandite, ettrin- gite and C(A)SH occur to form carbonates such as vaterite, aragonite and calcites, while the clinker phases do not show a large reactivity in the time period of sample investigation. The influence of Na-MFP on a carbonated cement paste is stabilizing secondary portlandite, ettringite and C(A)SH, possibly due to recovery of the basic character of the pore solution. Diffraction peaks of the crystalline phosphate mineral apatite were not observed within the time period of sample in- vestigation and are also not expected to occur at any later sample age. The latter assumption is un- derpinned by the existence of several studies on thermodynamic calculations, the high pH destabi- lizing apatite and by the existence of Mg 2 + in the pore solution. Future work by polarized light and electron mi- croscopy will give more insight in the composition of the Amorphous Calcium Phosphates (ACP’s) that are forming in paragenesis with C(A)SH phases in slag-rich carbonated cement paste treated with the inorganic self-healing agent Na-MFP.

SEM is an important tool to carry out concrete, cement and aggregate microstructure characterization. SEM imaging facilitates identification of elements in concrete. Thanks to the higher spatial resolution, and the analytical capabilities, it allows to perform a materials-imaging-related analysis. Many information can thus be extracted from these data, such as composition, phase abundance and distribution. In particular, during the last years, backscattered electron imaging of polished surfaces became an important method for the study of cement and concrete microstructures. The technique has many advantages, as the possibility to visualize representative cross-sections over a wide range of magnifications and to correlate image contrast with materials composition (i.e. atomic number). Comparing the information acquired starting from SEM imaging and X-ray microanalysis, the complex microstructure of concrete can be analyzed and images with sub-micrometer definition acquired and processed, obtaining compositional, morphological and morphometric information allowing to understand and evaluate the mechanism affecting the interaction of the aggregates with the cement paste. A common image representative of the ITZ in concrete involves approximately a domain of about 30 µm surrounding each aggregate and showing, theoretically, an increase of the porosity at the aggregate interface. In order to study this transition zone, 12 different types of concrete mixtures were analyzed, characterized by different combination of cement and virgin/recycled aggregates. The influence of these aggregates (i.e. virgin and recycled) on the resulting concrete microstructure was studied. The significant morphological and overall textural characteristics (i.e. area with higher porosity around aggregate, micro-cracks, size of the crystals in the ITZ) were detected by SEM analysis. Image analysis and SEM investigation, obtained from different concrete samples, provided very interesting results due to the different porosity and the possible interactions between the aggregates and the cement paste. Keywords: Recycled aggregates, concrete, Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ), SEM, image analysis I. Introduction The possibility to reutilize aggregates, resulting from recycling of End-Of-Life (EOL) concrete, repre- sents a challenge in the sector. In these last years, more and more recycled coarse aggregates have been proven to be commercially and technically sound for both non-structural and structural appli- cations. Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) behavior and characteristics are strongly conditioned and influ- enced by the "source" waste aggregates, the adopted concrete mix design, the operative conditions to re- alize the mix, and the intrinsic RAC attributes (i.e. mineralogical composition, surface status, morpho- logical and morphometrical properties). A preemi- nent role in final concrete characteristics is played by the cohesive interface properties resulting from RAC utilization, properties strongly linked to Inter- facial Transition Zone (ITZ) characteristics, old mor- tar quality and the old mortar content of the origi- nal concrete (Xia et al., 2013). The ITZ, that is the region between aggregate and cement paste, is usually characterized by a 299 Bonifazi et al. Figure 1: Polished sections of the investigated samples, as resulting after specimen preparation, finalized to perform SEM analyses. The details about the adopted samples labelling is reported in Table 1. different microstructure than the bulk paste. ITZ microstructure characterization is usually carried out analyzing Backscattered Electron Images (BEI) ob- tained by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) based investigations. Following this approach ITZ higher porosity and lower content of un-hydrated cement grains, in respect of the bulk paste, is usually de- tected. These characteristics change according to aggregate surface distance up to reach those of the bulk paste. This distance is usually defined as ITZ thickness (Elsharief et al., 2003). Water-cement ratio (w/c) has been considered to have only small effect on the ITZ microstructure (Scrivener, 1999). Mortar and concrete porosity in the ITZ is higher compared to the bulk of the hardened paste. Fresh concrete subjected to compaction shows, around the areas of the granules, a greater size of the aggregate and a water film (of hundreds of microns) collecting bleeding water. As result a higher water/cement ratio occurs in the ITZ in respect of the cement matrix, this fact determines, as a consequence, a higher porosity in the ITZ. The formation of the first-crystalline germs of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) and ettringite (3CaO.Al 2 O 3 .3CaSO 4 .32H 2 O), occurring through- out the cementitious matrix (i.e. cement silicates and aluminates hydration), is followed by a greater crystal growth of these products in the transition area and a corresponding production of higher porosity due to the "local" existence of higher water- Table 1: Concrete samples labelling according to utilized aggregates and cement based recipes C1 and C2 (see Table 2).

This latter effect can be attributed to the "wall effect" leading to a relatively low con- centration of large cement particles in the ITZ pro- ducing, as a consequence, an increased porosity. During cement hydration the pores in the ITZ are partially filled, according to a redistribution of cal- cium hydroxide and calcium-silicate-hydrates (C- S-H) (Elsharief et al., 2003). The ITZ of individual aggregates can be interconnected depending on their width and the content of aggregates. Such connectivity, or percolation, is considered as an important characteristic that can influence and/or condition the permeability and transport properties of mortar and concrete (Leemann et al., 2006). Ex- tra pore space, originally associated with the wall effect in ordinary concrete, is thus mostly filled up by deposits of calcium hydroxide and by deposits of (C-S-H) passing through solution, leading to the retention of only a relatively low residual extra av- erage pore content within the ITZ (Diamond and Huang, 2001). Historically, recycled aggregates properties were studied through the evaluation of mix workability and "final product" compressive strength. The long- term properties evaluation/comparison of normal and recycled based aggregates concretes, studying shrinkage and creep phenomena, was also carried out. However, few studies have been conducted on exploring the microstructure of recycled aggregate concrete and interactions with cement paste (Poon et al., 2004). ITZ characteristics can be qualitatively revealed via SEM performing a BSE analysis. A BSE image, in fact, depends on the mean atomic number of the concrete constituents. The grey scale of a BSE image is thus linked to the composition and textu- ral attributes of the investigated regions (Hussina and Poleb, 2011). Following this strategy porosity and individuals (i.e. cement particles and/or crys- tals) are clearly evidenced (i.e. epoxy impregnated pores are seen as black). Furthermore the possi- bility to perform a digital processing of the image could allow to quantify several topological and mor- phometrical attributes ITZ related. Combining the information derived from the BSE images and those obtained by EDX analysis (i.e. maps of elements) on the same ITZ areas, it is thus possible to acquire a huge amount of information allowing to evalu- ate the interaction existing between aggregates and cement paste, in respect of different recipes and aggregates origin: virgin or recycled. The results reported in this paper are re- lated to some ITZ studies performed inside a project financed by the European Union (EU): Collaborative Project n.265189, C2CA: "Ad- vanced Technologies for the Production of Cement and Clean Aggregates from Construction and Demo- lition Waste" (http://www.c2ca.eu/activities/the- c2ca-project/) whose main target is to compare the interaction of cement/aggregate between nat- ural and recycled aggregates. The C2CA project, in fact, aims to develop a cost-effective approach for recycling EOL concrete high-volume streams into prime-grade aggregates and cement. To reach this goal an innovative low-cost combined com- minution/classification, called Advanced Dry Recov- ery (ADR) was applied to EOL concrete in order to produce secondary cleaned aggregates, removing at the same time the presence of fines and light con- taminants, in size class interval ranging between 1 and 4 mm. The utilization of the ADR approach allows to break the bonds existing between by mois- ture and fine particles and to realize a materials classification independent from their moisture con- tent. After breaking up the material into a jet, the fine particles are separated from the coarse particles. ADR separation produces as results the aggregates concentrations into a coarse aggregate product and the production of fine fraction constituted by ce- ment paste and contaminants (i.e. wood, plastics and foams) (Lotfi et al., 2014). II. Materials and methods The study was performed with reference to 12 dif- ferent types of concrete mixtures (Figure 1) realized utilizing different aggregates and cement. The se- lected aggregates were constituted by virgin ones and as resulting from recycling according to dif- ferent sequential autogenous and ADR based com- minution strategies (Table 1). EOL concrete was preliminary milled by autogenous milling, then the -16 cm fraction was fed to ADR. Two series of con- crete, identified as C1 and C2 were produced by Holcim and HeidelbergCement AG, respectively, utilizing different cements and mix designs. Their characteristics are outlined in Table 2. All the analyses have been carried out by a SEM equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spec- troscopy (EDS) analytical unit. Cast samples were cut in slices of about 1 cm thickness. From each slice a prismatic sample of about 2x1x1cm (Figure 2) was realized and utilized for polished samples preparation (Figure 3). To reach this goal, concrete "prismatic specimens" were immersed in ethanol and impregnated with epoxy resin. Samples were then cut by diamond-bladed saw and polished, utilizing a series of abrasive pa- pers (i.e. 240, 600, 1000 and 2000 grit) for about 2 min each, with white spirit. Finally, a diamond paste of 3 µm on a low-relief polishing cloth was utilized for a further surface specimen polishing. Polishing was manually carried out for about 2 min. Samples were examined by a S2500 Hitachi SEM Microscope equipped with Kevex 8000 for X-ray microanalysis. Polished samples were examined 301 Bonifazi et al.

Detection was performed with a low acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Six magnifications, i.e. 50x, 100x, 150x, 200x and 400x were adopted. Images were "randomly" acquired around aggregates in order to statistically guarantee the representative of the analyses. SEM analyses have been carried out in order to identify and quantitatively assess, the most signif- icant morphological, morphometrical and overall textural characteristics of the ITZ, that is: i) pres- ence of regions of porosity around aggregates, ii) presence of micro-cracks, iii) presence of multi-layer oriented crystals around the aggregates and iv) size of the crystals detected in the ITZ. Micro-cracks around the ITZ have been observed at low mag- nification (50x). ITZ morphological and porosity characteristics have been identified adopting an in- termediate magnification (from 200x to 300x). Crys- tal presence (i.e. ettringite or hydroxide of calcium) and size have been detected at high magnification (from 400x to 2000x). X-ray mapping was systemat- ically utilized (400x) to identify the possible pres- ence of the ITZ in respect of cementiceous matrix. III. Results The C1C-REF sample (Figure 4a), constituted by vir- gin crushed aggregates, shows a variable porosity around greater aggregates. The average dimension of the pore, detectable in the ITZ. is about 30 µm. The effect of water bleeding is quite evident (Fig- ure 4b). A clear separation between aggregates and cement matrix exists. Oriented multi-layer crystals structures can be also identified in the areas char- acterized by a higher porosity (i.e. water bleeding Air entrainer none none Consistency Class S3 S3 Aggregate grading DIN A-B 16 mm DIN A-B 16 mm effect) around bigger aggregates (Figure 4c). The C1R-REF sample (Figure 5a), composed with roundish aggregates, shows an ITZ characterized by a lower porosity in comparison of that detected in C1C-REF sample. A complete detachment of the aggregate from cement matrix can be observed (Figure 5c). The average thickness of ITZ is about 40-50 µm. X-ray mapping shows a higher calcium concentration around the biggest aggregates and a lower, as found in C1C-REF sample, silicate content (Figure 5b). These phenomena can be associated to the presence of calcium hydroxide along the ITZ. The C2-REF matrix is well linked with the aggre- gates. Micro-cracks at low magnification (Figure 6a) are practically undetectable. ITZ average area is below 5 µm in this sample (Figure 6b) changes of matrix cement structure and characteristics around aggregates are not detected. Micro-cracks can be observed only at higher magnification (Figure 6c). Micro-cracks, for their characteristics, can be associ- ated to cement shrinkage and not to point of weak- ness around aggregate. Making a comparison with the results obtained for C1R-REF it results clear as C2-REF samples present better ITZ characteristics than C1R-REF. This difference can be mainly at- tributed to the morphological and morphometrical characteristics of the aggregates. Cement matrix of C2-B100-100 sample is well linked with the aggregates. The presence of micro- cracks is not significantly detectable (Figure 7a) both at low and high magnification. Around the aggregates no significant variation in the cement matrix is observed. The presence of oriented ag- gregates, due to bleeding effect, is also evidenced (Figure 7b). The ITZ is very small with an average dimension ranging between 6 and 8 µm (Figure 7c).

Figure 6: BEI based image acquisition of concrete C2-REF sample at 50x (6a), 200x (6b) and 400x (6c) magnification, respectively. Micro-fractures are almost absent. ITZ character- istics are in good agreement with the operative con- ditions adopted for the EOL concrete comminution and the adopted low water/cement (W/C) ratio in concrete mix design. The results obtained for C2-B100-100 sample also fit with those of C2-D15-100 sample. Based on their analysis, in fact, it is clear as EOL concrete feed rate to ADR is not so important with respect to the milling actions carried out and the adopted concrete mix design. C1-B100-100 sample shows an ITZ extremely complex, with a high porosity and a large pres- ence of micro-fractures. Furthermore the BEI shows as a marked difference between matrix and cement and as the ITZ, surrounding the aggregates, shows the presence of oriented crystal aggregates due to water bleeding effects. The visualized transition zone is characterized by a width around 65 µm (Fig- ure 8a). The analyses carried out by EDS produce an elements mapping confirming the probable pres- ence, in the ITZ, of calcium hydroxide (Figure 8b). The pores of larger dimension are characterized by the presence of clearly visible great size crystals of ettringite and calcium hydroxide (Figure 8c). C1-C50-100 sample shows an area around greater aggregates, characterized by high porosity. In this area (ITZ) the presence of micro-cracks is evident (Figure 9a). Comparing the elements map (Fig- ure 9b), resulting from EDS analysis, is possible to detect the presence all around the aggregates of Ca. The thickness of the area showing the presence of Ca is of about 30 µm). BEI determinations show the presence of an ITZ of 50 µm average thickness. At higher magnification (400x), it is possible to de- tect, inside the ITZ, the presence of dark regions, representative of a marked porosity. The presence of micro-aggregates, ranging between 5 and 20 µm, is noticeable and the texture that they originates can be clearly attributed to water bleeding effects (Figure 9c). C2-C50-100 sample shows the presence of old ce- ment paste attached to the aggregates. Analyses show that the old cement is characterized by a dif- ferent matrix, embedding small calcium carbonate individuals and/or aggregates. The presence of micro-cracks is low (Figure 10a). Apparently, any marked discontinuity seems to exists, between the old and new concrete (Figure 10b). The dimension of ITZ is not relevant, being the detected thickness always below 10 µm (Figure 10c). These results are quite interesting, evidencing Figure 7: C2-B100-100 concrete sample. BEI image fields acquired at different magnification: 50x (7a), 200x (7b) and 400x (7c) magnification. 304 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 8: C1-B100-100 concrete sample.

BEI image field acquired at 400x (8c). as ITZ characteristics are not particularly influ- enced by the utilization of recycled aggregates, on condition that correct operative conditions to recy- cled aggregates and proper concrete manufacturing recipes are adopted. C1-D15-100 sample is characterized by a high porosity, clearly identified by the presence of darker color regions around the aggregates, mainly around the big ones (Figure 11a). The presence of micro- cracks, detectable inside the ITZ (Figure 11b), is also noticeable. ITZ thickness ranges in average, be- tween 30-40 µm and below. ITZ texture, pictorially evidenced by grey tone variations, is clearly due to a marked bleeding water effect (Figure 11c). C2-D15-100 sample does not show a high poros- ity around the ITZ. The presence of the old cement matrix is quite evident (Figure 12a). Any marked discontinuity linked to the old (i.e. presence of indi- viduals, constituted by cement and aggregates, be- longing to the utilized EOL concrete ) and new con- crete (Figure 12b) seems not to be present, porosity is low and material composition around aggregates does not present significant variations (Figure 12c). Making a comparison with the corresponding sample (C1-D15-100) obtained with a different mix design, it seems quite clear the role that these pa- rameters play in respect of the final attributes of concrete, as well as ITZ characteristics. Analyzing the C1-A100-100 sample (Figure 13a), the presence of micro-cracks inside the cementitious matrix is clear (Figure 13a). The presence of old cement elements, around the bigger aggregates, is also detected as well as the presence of micro-cracks all around the ITZ of new concrete and inside the old one (Figure 13b). At higher magnification (400x), darker areas, representative of porosities and/or physical discontinuities inside the sample, can be detected. The ITZ average thickness is estimated to be 30 µm (Figure 13c). The C2-A100-100 sample does not show the pres- ence of a significant amount of micro-cracks inside the cementitious matrix (Figure 14a). The maps of element confirm the presence of calcium hydroxide in the ITZ (Figure 14b). ITZ average thickness, de- tected at higher magnification (400x), is about 12 µm (Figure 14c). Also for the detected textural char- acteristics of samples C1-A100-100 and C2-A100- 100 the considerations already done for samples C1-D15-100 and C2-D15-100 are valid; these are the influence of water water/cement (w/c) ratio and Figure 9: C1-C50-100 concrete sample.

Making a comparison between the two pairs of C1-A100-100, C2-A100-100 and C1-D15-100, C2- D15-100 samples, it is also quite clear the influence that autogenous mill tilt angle set-up and feed rate play on ITZ. C1-ADR-100 is characterized, in respect of the other samples, by the marked presence of micro- cracks all around the greater aggregates. Further- more the ITZ can be identified also at lower mag- nification (Figure 15a). The map of the elements referred to calcium, silicon and oxygen confirms the probable presence of calcium hydroxide in the transition zone between matrix and aggregate (Fig- ure 15b). ITZ also shows a marked porosity, its thickness varies between 50 and 70 µm and the presence of oriented crystals, determined by wa- ter bleeding effect (Figure 15c), can also be clearly detected. 307 Bonifazi et al. IV. Conclusion The micro-structure and the attributes of the ITZ in different concrete sample, realized with natural and recycled aggregates of different characteristics, according to different comminution strategies (i.e. adoption of autogenous milling and different ADR feeding conditions) and adopting different concrete mix designs was carried out. According to the achieved results, it is possible to affirm as concrete samples produced by natural roundish aggregates (i.e. C2-REF samples) and those produced with recycled aggregates (i.e. C2- C50-100), obtained after ADR processing with a medium feed rate (i.e. 50 t/h), adopting the same concrete C2 mix design (i.e. low water/cement ratio), seems to be characterized by the presence of an ITZ with an average thickness of about 2 µm. This result is in good agreement with the operative conditions adopted to produce aggregates (i.e. lower values of ADR feed produce a higher degree of liberation of aggregates form the matrix) and concrete mix design (C1 and C2). Samples C2-D15-100 and C2-B100-100 show an ITZ characterized by an average thickness ranging between 2-5 µm and 5-12 µm, respectively. These results are clearly influenced by ADR feeding set up. For sample C2-A100-100 the values of ITZ increase in agreement with the different autogenous mill operative conditions, in respect of those adopted for samples C2-D15-100 and C2-B100-100, that is higher tilt angle and, as a consequence, lower residence time of the material in the mill before to be fed to ADR. Comparing ITZ characteristics detected for the concrete obtained with natural roundish (i.e. C1R- REF) and crushed (i.e. C1C-REF) aggregates, adopt- ing the same C1 mix design (i.e. high water/cement ratio), it is possible to see as the first sample shows lower ITZ thickness values (about 50 µm) than the second one (about 60 µm). Such behavior can prob- ably due to the different aggregates morphological and morphometrical attributes. On the contrary, comparing the ITZ concrete samples characteris- tics as resulting from the utilization of recycled ag- gregates not preliminary milled, but directly feed to ADR (C1-ADR-100), the results, independently from recipes, show the highest ITZ thickness, the highest porosity and the larger presence of micro- cracks. The study of the ITZ for all the investigated sam- ples shows that: • autogenous milling-ADR based combined com- minution influence aggregates characteristics (i.e. aggregate degree of liberation in respect of cementitious matrix, • the water/cement (w/c) ratio in mix concrete 308 is influenced by the aggregates degree of liber- ation and, as a consequence, the ITZ character- istics will change, • a clear correlation can be established among recycled aggregates production strategies, se- lected concrete manufacturing mix designs, ITZ characteristics, concrete mechanical behav- ior and durability. Further studies will be addressed to validate the obtained results, analyzing more concrete samples produced with the same mix designs and to assess ITZ attributes adopting imaging based strategies.

The presence of porous adherent paste in the recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) leads to a greater water absorption that must be taken into account in the formulation of concrete. Depending on the saturation state of RCA, the microstructure of the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) between old paste adhering to RCA and new cement paste differs and could influence the mechanical properties of concrete containing RCA. In this work, we characterize the ITZ between the old and the new cement paste for two moisture conditions of aggregate (dry and over-saturated). Two mortars, one based on natural aggregates (NA) and the other on RCA, were manufactured with the same volume of dry aggregates and the same effective water to cement ratio. The ITZ after 2 and 28 days of hydration is characterized by scanning electron microscopy. From the image analysis, the proportions of anhydrous phase, hydrated phase and porosity are computed as a function of distance to interface. The porosity in the ITZ of mortars containing RCA is larger than that of mortars made with natural aggregates. After two days of hydration, the average porosity in the ITZ of mortar with over-saturated RCA is slightly higher than that with dry RCA. But the saturation state of aggregate has a significant influence on the distribution of porosity in the ITZ. However, after 2 and 28 days of curing, the compressive strengths of mortars containing dry and over-saturated RCA are close and the different distribution of porosity in the two ITZ do not influence significantly the mechanical properties of mortars. Keywords: recycled concrete aggregate, microstructure, interfacial transition zone I. Introduction The construction industry is a large consumer of natural resources. In the same time, it gener- ates large amounts of construction and demolition wastes that eventually end up in landfills without any form of recovery. According to the European Union directive 2008/98/EC, one aim is to increase recycling of construction and demolition waste to at least 70 % by the year 2020 (Blengini et al. 2012). The recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) have the potential to replace natural resources however it is necessary to assess the effect of recycled aggregates on the final concrete. RCA are composed of a mixture of natural aggre- gates roughly coated with hardened cement paste. The presence of cement paste which is very porous leads to a greater absorption of water that must be taken into account in the formulation of the con- crete. In concrete, the amount of water available for cement hydration, the quality of the bond zone between aggregates and cement paste and the qual- ity of the RCA strongly influence its mechanical properties. The quality of this bond zone depends on the presence or not between the aggregate and the bulk cement paste of a more porous cement paste zone than the bulk paste called interfacial transition zone (ITZ). Several authors (Scrivener et al. 1996; Ollivier et al. 1995; Scrivener et al. 2004) have studied in details the microstructure of the ITZ and its forming mechanisms. The ITZ is constituted by a cement paste with a microstructure gradient between the bulk cement paste and the aggregate: the porosity and the port- landite content increases in the ITZ from the bulk cement paste to the aggregate surface. This mi- crostructure gradient is mainly the consequence of the “wall effect” by the aggregate on the fine ce- ment particles. Because of this “wall effect” the initial cement content decreases and respectively the water content increases from the bulk cement 309 Le et al. paste to the aggregate surface. The thickness of the disturbed area by the “wall effect” is of several tens of microns and corresponds to the initial thickness of the ITZ. During the hardening and because of a filling of the porosity by the hydrated products the depth of the ITZ generally decreases. During the hardening, a mechanism of transport of the hydrated products (mainly the portlandite) occurs from the rich to the poor cement area. Because of the portlandite transport the formation of a “du- plex film” rich in portlandite of few microns can be observed at the aggregate surface. In the case of concrete based on RCA, three different kinds of ITZ are present: ITZ within the RCA, ITZ between the old and new cement paste, ITZ between the new paste and natural aggregate present in the RCA. The difficulty to control the quality of recycled aggregate leads to different conclusions in literature. We can find different contradictory opinions on the influence of absorption on quality of ITZ and on mechanical properties. Du et al. (2010) used the digital micro-hardness meter to characterize the strength of ITZ and re- ported that the micro-hardness of the RCA was much higher than that of the ITZ in concrete based on RCA, and the micro-hardness of the interface between the the old cement paste of recycled ag- gregate and the new paste was the lowest. On the other hand, Tam et al. (2005) and Etxeberria et al. (2006) concluded that the old mortar of the RCA formed the weak link in the concrete based on RCA due to the presence of many porosity and micro-cracks within the RCA. According to Xiao et al. (2012) and Rasheeduzzafar et al. (1984), the failure behavior of concrete based on RCA depends on the relative quality of old ITZ and new ITZ. In the work of Xiao et al. (2012), the first bond crack appeared around the weakest link, the ITZs, and then propagated into the mortar region approxi- mately along the loading direction. For modeled recycled concrete aggregate and concrete based on RCA, the microcrack location, size and shape in the ITZs were significantly influenced by the relative strengths of the old mortar and new mortar. When the strength of the new ITZ was lower than that of the old ITZ, the first observable crack mostly appeared at the new ITZ region. Also, when the strength of the new ITZ was better than that of the old ITZ, the first observable crack mostly appeared in the old ITZ area. Contrary to the common opin- ion, Nagataki et al. (2004) reported that the primary parameter determining the quality of the concrete based on RCA is not always the adhered mortar. Xiao et al. (2012) concluded that the old mortar of the RCA forms the weak link in RAC, which is composed of many porosities and cracks. These pores and cracks increase the consumption of water, leading to less water for hydration at the new ITZ. Zhao (2014) studied the microstructure of ITZ in concrete based on RCA by SEM. SEM observa- tions of recycled mortars with saturated fine RCA demonstrated that the new ITZ can clearly be seen, while with dried fine RCA, the new ITZ zone cannot clearly be seen. It means the properties of new ITZ are improved by the water absorption of fine RCA. And a higher compressive strength with dried fine RCA than that with saturated fine RCA was also observed. Another study carried out on the influence of saturation state of different aggregate of different absorption coefficients on the properties of mortars has been performed by Nguyen (2013). In the case of low porosity limestone aggregate, a little or no difference in the porosity in the ITZ between mor- tars based on dry and wet sand limestone all along the distance from aggregate is observed. However, in the case of more porous limestone aggregates, the porosity in the ITZ is much higher for the mor- tars based on wet sand than that of mortars based on dry sand. In the case of large absorption co- efficient, the higher porosity in the ITZ obtained for saturated aggregates in comparison to dry ones could explain the lower mechanical strengths. As a conclusion, the quality of ITZ depends on the surface characteristics of aggregate particles, chemical bonding, absorption and saturation state Table 1: Physical properties of the sands.

A few studies about the saturation state of aggregate on the properties of ITZ are car- ried out. A few quantitative studies have been carried out on the new ITZ in the RAC and on the influence of saturation state of aggregate on its properties. However, there is no quantitative study of new ITZ in RAC. The aim of this work is to characterize the ITZ, particularity at a mesoscopic scale, between the old and the new paste of cement for different ages of curing and then to compare them to ITZ of mortar based on natural aggregate. II. Figure 1: Cumulated particle size distribution of the sands (NS and RS). Materials and methods The RCA and natural sand are provided by the Na- tional French Project for Research and Development RECYBETON. For the preparation of the mortars, the RCA were crushed and sieved to obtain the same grain size distribution as the natural sand (NS) (Figure 1). The recycled sand (RS) is reconsti- tuted from the six size fractions, according to the size of the natural sand. The physical properties of the sands are given in Table 1. The cement used in the study is an ordinary Portland cement OPC (CEM II/A-L 42,5N CE CP2 NF). Measurement of the moisture content and absorp- tion coefficient of aggregates is essential, because if the methods of formulation enable determination of the optimum dosage of water in concrete, it should take into account the water contained or absorbed by the aggregates to determine the effective water content. The effective water content is defined in the case of absorbing aggregates as the difference between the total water present in the fresh concrete and the water absorbed by aggregates. In order to study the effect of saturation degree of aggregate on the microstructure and mechanical properties, wet and dry sand (respectively labeled WS and DS) have been used. DS was obtained by oven drying at 105 C until constant mass. WS was pre-saturated in a plastic box and stored in a room at 20 C for one week. The amount of water added to the pre-saturation is equal the amount of absorbed water plus 10%, so the water content is equal to W 24h +10%. The water absorption of NS was determined by standard method (0.5%). How- ever, in the case of RS, the water absorption was calculated as the average of the water absorption measured by the standard method 6.8% and the one measured by evaporometry method 11.6% (Mech- ling et al. 2003). So the water absorption of RS use in here is 10%. The relative amount of water W WS in wet sand is calculated as: W WS = 100 · M WS M DS M DS (1) where M WS and M DS are respectively the weight of wet and dry sand. The mortars were formulated to have effective water to cement mass ratio (w/c) of 0.5 and an identical volume of sand of around 60% in both mortars (sand to cement ratio of 3 based on dry natural aggregate) so any water in the aggregate has to be subtracted from the water to be used in batching the mortar. Mix proportions are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Compositions of the mortars with different moisture states of sand.

The specimens were demoulded the following day, then cured under water at 20 C and tested at 2 and 28 days. Compressive strengths were measured according to the European standard EN 196-1. For the microscopical investigations, pieces of hydrated samples of 1 ⇥ 2 ⇥ 2 cm 3 were cut from the core of mortar bars. Two main methods are available to stop hydration and remove the water: freeze drying and solvent exchange. The disad- vantage of the freeze drying method is the pres- ence of many micro cracks in the cement matrix (Zhang & Scherer 2011). We chose the solvent ex- change method using isopropanol-2 as solvent and immersion of the sample for one week. The sam- ples were then passed to vacuum to remove solvent and stored in a desiccator with silica gels. After- ward, they were impregnated using a low viscosity epoxy and polished down to 0.25 µm using dia- mond pastes. The samples were further coated with carbon ( ⇠ 5 nm) and examined using a Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) from FEI coupled to an Oxford INCA X-sight energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyzer. The sample is introduced into the chamber of the SEM setting a mode high vacuum to avoid disruptions and analytical distance of 10mm. We chose a volt- age of 15kV for optimum observation through the analysis of secondary and backscattered electrons. A slow scanning speed was chosen (1-2 photos / min) to capture an image. SEM is used in imaging mode "backscattered electron diffraction" (BSE) for studies of polished sections. This observation mode provides better contrast between different phases in the cementitious material (Figure 2). Backscattered electron imaging has been used to study the ITZ in mortars following the lead of Scrivener et al. (1987). Around 30 BSE images of a field 182 ⇥ 167 µm 2 that corresponds to a resolu- tion of 0.18 µm per pixel, were acquired per sample which make it possible to detect elements with di- mensions 0.03 µm 2 . The fractions of anhydrous cement, hydrates and porosity were evaluated in 8 bands of 10 µm in width, around 250 µm long (Diamond 2001; Basheer et al. 2005; Elsharief et al. 2003). The results were plotted against distance from the aggregate and averaged over the 30 im- ages. The relative area of each component in each band was calculated from the grey level histogram. The lower threshold level of pores has been set to zero (black pixel). Several methods are available for determining the thresholds on the histogram of an image (Hemavibool 2007; Scrivener et al. 2004; Brough et al. 2000). In this study, we used inflection points on the graph of accumulated area depend- ing on the intensity of the image to determine the thresholds as proposed by Wong et al. (2006). 312 A visual comparison of the compatibility between the image and the phase contrast image is first car- ried out to validate the selected thresholds. To facili- tate comparison, the images are enlarged. If there is an underestimation or overestimation of the phases, the thresholds are shifted until the isolated phases are compatible with the base image (Figure 3). The Delesse principle states that the two-dimensional areas of profiles of components are related to the three-dimensional volumes occupied in space by these components, assuming random distribution and random orientation of components (Delesse 1848). The porosity deduced by this method is lim- ited by the pixel size, thus very fine capillary and C-S-H pores cannot be separated and are included in the area of hydrated products (Diamond 2001). The distance measured from the aggregate surface on a random section overestimates the true perpen- dicular distance in three dimensions (Scrivener et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2007). It is difficult to correct the distances unless measurements are made only on interfaces that are normal to the image planes as in (Head et al. 2008). In this study, the distance from aggregate is the distance measured on 2D sections without corrections. Considerations with regards to image analysis and its limitations in the study of the ITZ have been discussed in literature and not detailed here (Scrivener et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2006). When the thresholds are known, seg- mentation phase is performed using a programmed Matlab tool. III. Results Mechanicals properties The mechanical tests are carried out after 2 and 28 days of curing. The results are presented in Figure 7. The mortars based on natural sand present larger compressive strengths than the mortars based on recycled sand. The strength loss is almost 20 MPa at 28 days when replacing NS by RS. This loss of strength can be explained by a lower quality of transition zone, a lower strength of RS compared to the cement matrix and/or an incorrect estimation of water absorption coefficient. We can also notice that the initial saturation state of aggregates has little influence on the mechanical properties if we work with the same effective water- cement ratio. This result was expected in the case of natural sand with a low porosity, and is in agree- ment with previous studies on sands of limestone with low porosity (Nguyen et al. 2014). The case of RS is, at first sight, more surprising. Indeed, it had previously been shown in the case of porous limestone aggregate (Nguyen et al. 2014), that the effective water calculation underestimates 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 2: Backscattered image of mortar based on dry recycled sand at 2 days. In dotted line, the limit between old cement paste of the RCA and the new cement paste. the water released by the aggregates. This excess water carries with it a more porous transition zone and leads to a decrease in the mechanical prop- erties of mortar based on saturated aggregates in comparison to mortar containing dried aggregates. SEM observation and image analysis SEM images of mortar with dry and oversaturated sand at 2 and 28 days, are presented in Figures 5 to 8. In the case of mortar based on natural sand, the border between natural aggregate and cement paste can easily be found; it is a natural siliceous aggregate so the difference is very clear. In the case of RM, at two days of hydration, the degree of hydration of the new cement paste is still low, but the old paste cement is mature, so we can easily distinguish the boundary between the two pastes. With RM-Sat at two days of hydration, a wide layer of portlandite is formed on the surface of the former paste. The duplex film zone is rich in portlandite and has been described by previous authors (Barnes et al. 1978; Ollivier et al. 1995; Nguyen 2013) At 28 days, in the case of RM-Dry, we cannot distinguish anymore the boundary between the old and new cement paste and plot the ITZ. However, for RM-Sat, the layer of portlandite is still present that permits to plot the boundary between the old and new cement paste. Figure 9 presents the average porosity of ITZ after two days of hydration from around 30 images. At two days of hydration, it is found in the case of RM-Sat a significant decrease of porosity in the first ten microns compared to the ITZ of other mortars. However, when we get away from the surface of the aggregates, the porosity is higher in the case of mortar of over-saturated recycled sand. Comparing both ITZ of mortars made from recy- cled sand, the average porosity of the ITZ in both saturation states is close (22.2% and 24.1% respec- tively for RM-Dry and RM-Sat). However the state of saturation, in the case of RM, significantly influ- ences the distribution of the porosity in this zone. In the case of mortars composed of NS (low porosity sand), the average porosity and the poros- ity distribution of ITZ in both saturation states, dry and over-saturated, is identical. This result is in agreement with previous studies on calcareous sands with low porosity (Nguyen 2013). Figure 10 presents the percent of anhydrous ce- ment in ITZ after two days of hydration. The wall effect can here clearly be observed. In fact, the cement concentration increases with the distance from interface. This observation concerns both ag- gregates (natural and recycled sand) and both satu- ration states (dry or over saturated). However, this effect is less important for the re- cycled sand at over-saturated state. This result may be due to the draining of water out of recycled ag- gregate that can push the cement grains away from the surface of the aggregates. At 28 days, the porosity of ITZ is decreased in comparison to mortars after 2 days. The distribu- tion of porosity in ITZ of NM is coherent with the literature corresponding to low absorption aggre- gates: high porosity in the first twenty microns, but from twenty microns the porosity is reduced and 313 Le et al.

It can be seen that the porosity between 10 and 60 µm Figure 9: Average porosity of ITZ at 2 days with distance from the aggregate. Figure 10: Gradient of anhydrous cement in ITZ at 2 days. is much larger when recycled aggregates are satu- rated, probably because of a release of water from the aggregates. IV. Conclusion A low influence of moisture condition of recy- cled aggregates on the mechanical properties is observed. We observe a little difference between the compressive strength of both mortars, NM or RM, with dry sand or over-saturated sand. The ITZ of RM at two days of hydration has been easily found with a visible difference between the new and old cement paste. However, in the case of RM-Dry at 28 days of curing, the new ITZ has not been found because of a good continuity between the old and new cement paste. The new ITZ of RM-Sat at 28 days has been found with a layer of portlandite at the surface of old cement paste. With the RM, the moisture conditions of aggre- gate influence significantly the porosity distribu- tion in ITZ. A decrease of porosity in the first ten micrometers is observed for saturated aggregates. However, the average porosity of ITZ and the com- pressive strength of the two mortars, RM-Dry or RM-Sat, are identical, suggesting that the porosity distribution in the ITZ does not affect significantly the mechanical properties. Some experiments are in progress and consist to identify the adhesive “p” parameter and the ag- gregate strength “q” parameter of RCA and NA according to the De Larrard approach (De Larrard 1999). These identifications could help us to have a better understanding of the local mechanical behav- ior of these mortars and to answer the following question: are the lowest mechanical properties of RCA mortar in comparison to NA mortar mainly due to a lower strength of RCA or to a more porous interphase because of a higher average effective water cement ratio?

For utilizing RA in high-grade applications, it is essential to monitor and minimise the content of the pollutants. To this extent the C2CA concrete recycling process investigates a combination of smart demolition, followed by new innovative technologies to produce high-grade secondary aggregates with low amount of contaminants. This paper firstly reports the level of contaminants in different fractions of recycled aggregates coming from a real case study. Results show that the wood content of 4-16 mm recycled aggregates is well within the strictest limit of the EU standard. However, there are still large visible pieces of wood and plastic in the +16 mm RA fraction which, albeit within the standards, does not satisfy the users. In order to solve this problem the feasibility of applying two existing technologies (near infrared sensor sorting and wind sifting) to remove contaminants, is studied. Furthermore, two types of online quality control sensors (hyper spectral imaging and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy) are introduced and a summary of their recent developments towards the quality control of RA are presented. Keywords: construction and demolition waste (C&DW), recycled aggregate, contaminants, quality control I. Introduction The efficient high-grade recycling of Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) is of increasing in- terest from an environmental and economic per- spective. From an environmental point of view, the urgency of saving resources and reducing human- ity’s impact on the environment is evident. The need of increasing recycling and improving the quality and homogeneity of recycled materials to minimize environmental pollution and the use of primary resources is a topical subject for European Community (Enterprise and Industry reports of the EC). In order to enhance the quality of RA for high- grade applications, the content of contaminants such as organic materials (wood, plastic and foams), gypsum and glass must be minimised (Vegas, et al. 2015). Many organic substances such as wood are unstable in concrete when submitted to dry- ing and wetting or freezing and thawing (Hansen, 1990). Water-soluble sulphates (coming from gyp- sum plaster) in RA are reactive and may produce expansive reactions (Silva, et al. 2014) while struc- tural concrete containing RA with high chloride content may deteriorate more rapidly due to the corrosion of reinforcement bars (RA coming from concrete subjected to marine may have high soluble chloride content). Plate glass from windows has the density similar to the stone’s and brick’s and therefore it complicates its separation. Thus pre- sorting of the glass is essential also because of the alkali- silica reactions which can take place due to non-crystalline metastable silica (Hansen, 1990). Considering the importance of upgrading the quality of the RA and removing the contaminants, currently different technologies and procedures such as smart demolition and dismantling of End- Of-Life (EOL) buildings, automated sensor sorting and online quality control sensors have been de- veloped (Serranti, et al. 2012) and (Palmieri, et al. 2014) and (Xia, et al. 2014). A novel con- crete recycling process developed within an Eu- ropean funded project (Lotfi, et al. 2015), aims at a cost-effective system approach for recycling high- volume EOL concrete streams into high-quality aggregates and cement. The best practices and technologies implemented are smart demolition to 319 Lotfi et al. produce crushed concrete with low levels of con- taminants, followed by mechanical upgrading of the material on-site into an aggregate product and a cement-paste concentrate that can be processed (off-site) into a low-CO2 input material for new cement production. Sensor-based on-line quality assurance allow for a proper monitoring of the out- put. Achieving in-situ recycling of the EOL concrete is one of the main goals of this process. Therefore, the liberation of the cement paste as well as the sorting and size classification of the aggregate, is performed purely mechanically and in the moist state, i.e. without prior drying or wet screening. This choice reduces process complexity and avoids problems with dust or sludge while providing eco- nomic benefits in terms of process costs and logis- tics. After crushing, liberation of the cement paste is promoted by several minutes of grinding in a small-diameter (D = 2.2 m) autogenous mill and at the same time producing as little as possible fine silica. Then a new low-cost classification tech- nology, called Advanced Dry Recovery (ADR) is applied to remove the fines and light contaminants with an adjustable cut-point of between 1 and 4 mm for mineral particles. ADR uses kinetic energy to break the bonds that are formed by moisture and fine particles and is able to classify materials al- most independently of their moisture content. After breaking up the material into a jet, the fine parti- cles are separated from the coarse particles. ADR separation has the effect that the input aggregate is concentrated in two main streams: a coarse aggre- gate product and a fine fraction which includes the cement paste and contaminants (e.g. wood, plastics and foams). In the current study, the influence of different re- cycling steps in C2CA process (See Figure 1) in the level of contaminants is investigated and solutions to make clean final products are presented. The aim is to enrich our understanding of the importance of existing recycling steps with respect to eliminating the contaminants in recycled aggregate. II. III. Smart dismantling and selective demolition An EOL building may be conventionally or selec- tively demolished. Although the construction and demolition industries still see the concept of the selective demolition doubtful from economic point of view, it may be more profitable than the conven- End of life building (case study in Groningen) The case study of the C2CA project involved the de- molition of a governmental complex in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands and the building of an underground garage from concrete with recy- cled aggregate. The scope of the demolition part of the project mainly consisted of two identical high- rise towers (KB2 and KB6) with the blue dotted line in Figure 2. The section plan of the towers can be seen in Figure 3. 320 Figure 1: General layout of the C2CA technology show- ing different steps for contaminants removal. Two devel- oping sensors (HSI and LIBS) are being developed for the quality control of the products. Figure 2: Overview of the end of life buildings 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 3: Section plan of the EOL building tional demolition approach and the most effective way of minimising the amount of contaminants in CDW materials (Coelho, et al. 2011). In the 70’s and 80’s the Dutch construction sector used asbestos in the buildings. Therefore prior to the dismantling and demolition of KB2 and KB6 buildings, asbestos was removed and collected in the total amount of 40 tons. The further strategy for the dismantling of the KB2 and KB6 involved the detailed removing of all materials from the concrete skeleton before starting the demolition: air-conditioners, radiators, lamps, piping systems of water and heating, electric cables, carpets, gyp- sum plates from ceilings and walls, window glass, frames of doors and windows etc. For the demo- lition, two methods were applied: the top-down method to demolish the top 12 floors, and short- reach method to demolish the lowest 2 floors of the towers. The materials composition of KB2/KB6 tower can be seen in Figure 4. It demonstrates that the amount of EOL concrete was 87wt% of the whole CDW materials. IV. Figure 4: Material composition (wt%) of KB2/KB6 tower. constituents. Samples were portioned to 5-10 mm, 10-20 mm and +20 mm fractions and their contami- nants were hand-picked according to the procedure previously explained. Figure 6 shows the mass percentage of the hand- picked contaminants from mill input and output for three aforesaid fractions. Considering the results after milling, the mass of contaminants (bigger than 5 mm) is reduced by 30%. It appears that by milling, contaminants are broken down in smaller parts so that the less than 5 mm fraction increases. There is a clear effect of the milling also on the size reduction of brick (compare Figures 6-A with 6-D). A similar trend can be seen for wood contaminants albeit in a less outstanding way. In general it is observed that milling has an obvious effect on the size reduction of brick and a slight effect on size reduction of other contaminants. Autogenous milling Autogenous milling of the crushed End of Life (EOL) concrete is a mechanical method to remove cement paste from the surface of aggregates. Dur- ing autogenous milling, the combination of shear- ing and compression forces, promotes selective at- trition and delivers a better liberation of cement. Beside liberation of cement, the acting forces could affect the size of the contaminants. In this regard, a batch test with around 15 tons of crushed EOL concrete was carried out. The residence time of the materials inside of the mill was estimated as 12 minutes. About 2 tons of sample from both mill input and output was taken in order to analyse the Figure 5: Constituents of the contaminants mixed with concrete. 321 Lotfi et al. V. Screening and ADR processing In the C2CA concrete recycling process, autoge- nous milling of the materials is followed by a 16 mm screen and an ADR. Materials smaller than 16 mm are fed into the ADR and using a jet, the fines (0-4 mm) are separated from the coarse particles. The air knife installed in ADR helps to concentrate contaminants like wood, foam and plastic in the fines. In order to figure out the amount of wood in the coarse ADR products (4-16 mm RA) a sink floating test on approximately 1700 kg of RA and ac- cording to EN 12620 (for application of the material as coarse recycled aggregate) was carried out. Result shows that the total amount of floating wood in 4-16 mm RA is almost 0.117 cm3/kg which is well within the strictest norm of EU standard (EN 12620). ADR separation has the effect that the aggregate is concentrated into a coarse aggregate product and a fine fraction including the cement paste and contaminants such as wood, plastics and foams (see Figure 7B). ADR fines can be used as the input of cement kilns so that the wood and plastics contaminants are even beneficial for the process. During the first C2CA case study, it became clear that because of the contamination, the +16 mm frac- tion does not have the market potential as such (see Figure 7A). Therefore it would impair the economic attractiveness of the recycling process being devel- oped. According to the visual evidence, there are big contaminants of wood and non-ferrous metals in +16 mm oversize fraction. In order to satisfy the customers’ demands and use +16 mm RA for high-grade applications, contaminants should be removed from this fraction. Since +16 mm RA is a small stream (almost 30wt% a sensor sorter could be a cost effective option to clean this fraction. In this regard, the possibility of applying Near In- frared (NIR) sensor sorting technology to clean +16 mm RA was examined. NIR sensor sorting and wind sifting to remove contaminants from +16mm RA Advanced automated sensor-based sorting tech- nologies use physical – chemical properties of differ- ent materials such as density, electrical conductivity or magnetic susceptibility, as well as surface and material properties, such as NIR spectrum or the visible colour (Vegas, et al. 2015). For this part of study, NIR sensor sorting facility of TOMRA GmbH sorting in Germany was used (Figure 8 shows the functional principle). Input material (1) is evenly fed onto a conveyor belt, where it is detected by the NIR and/or VIS spectrometer (2). If the sensors detect material to be sorted out, it commands the control unit to blow the appropriate valves of the ejection module at the end of the conveyor belt. The Figure 6: A, B and C show the amount of contaminants in the +5mm input of the autogenous mill. D, E and F show the amount of contaminants in the +5mm output of the autogenous mill. 322 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 7: A) +16mm RA which still contain contaminants, B) ADR fines in which light contaminants like wood and foam are concentrated. detected materials are separated from the material flow by jets of compressed air. The sorted mate- rial is divided into two or three fractions in the separation chamber (3). For testing the performance of the NIR sen- sor sorting system, around 900 kg of +16 mm of crushed concrete was delivered to TOMRA sort- ing GmbH. During the experiment, contaminants (wood, plastic and metal) with size of 10-20 mm and +20 mm were added to the clean crushed con- crete. The output of the NIR sensor sorting system consists of an accepted portion (clean concrete) and ejected contaminations. Figure 9 shows an example of the input contaminants to the NIR sensor sorting system and accepted and ejected outputs. The process flow diagram for 20 t/h/m of the throughput shows that by using NIR sorting, almost 88% mass% of wood is thrown out and small pieces are left in the product. Plastic and metal are also removed (see Table 1 and 2). The investment cost of a NIR sorting system (in- cluding high speed conveyor and separation cham- ber) vary depending on the width of the system between approximately e95,000 (0.6 m width) to roughly e230,000 (2.8 m width). Considering the investment costs for other equipment which are needed to operate a NIR sorting system (com- pressor, cables, electrical equipment, conveyors for output fractions, installation) total investment cost would be e140,000 (0.6 m wide system) and e320,000 (2.8 m wide system). It is estimated that for a 2 meter width of the belt (40 t/h), with run- ning time of 1600 hours/year the cost of processing will be 1.2 euro/ton. Considering the above mentioned results, the only limitation with NIR sensor sorting system is its current inability to remove small contaminants which therefore remain in the accepted output. To reach a more accurate contaminants removal, the combination of the wind sifting technology with NIR sorting is considered beneficial. In this regard, a test was carried out to examine the performance of a wind sifter to remove plastic and wood. The test was performed at REDOX B.V. in the Netherlands (see Figure 10). The input materials of the wind sifter consisted of almost 500 kg of +16mm crushed concrete mixed with a specific amount of wood and plastic. According to the process flow diagram (see Table 3 and Table 4), it is concluded that wind sifting is able to remove 80% (by number) of wood and plastic contaminants from the stream (for 35t/h Table 1: Mass analysis of NIR input.

Big particles which are heavier can- not be removed and remain in the final products. In Figure 11 the remained big pieces of wood in the final product can be seen. The investment cost of the REDOX wind sifter is e75,000 euro. It is estimated that for a 40 t/h throughput, with running time of 1600 hours/year the cost of wind sifting process will be 0.1 euro/ton. VI. Sensors for On-line quality control LIBS Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is an optical spectroscopic technique employing a pulsed laser to produce a high power density light beam (>108 W/cm 2 ) to ablate tiny amounts of material from target material surface, resulting locally in high dissipation and accompanying breakdown of molecules or crystalline structures into a partly ion- ized plasma with plasma temperature and elec- tron density typically in the order of 104 K and 1018/cm3, respectively. During the cooling-off of the plasma, the fingerprint LIBS spectra including element specific atomic-ionic emission lines can be observed, whereby photon wavelengths may be linked to specific elements, allowing identification of the elements in the plasma which represents the target sample material. The number of photons pro- duced by a certain type of element may in principle be linked to the element concentration therein. The LIBS technique has great potential on real-time pro- cess and in-situ quality control: it has relative sim- Weight(gr) Mass, % 267900 10136 203 123 278362 96.24 3.64 0.07 0.04 100 ple instrumentation, fast measurement with only optical access, needs minute sample preparation etc. The LIBS experimental setup being developed within C2CA is shown in (Figure 12). This set- up consists of a 1064 nm Q-switched YAG-laser (11-25 mJ, 10 ns/pulse, 1-100 pulses/s), fibre-optics and focusing assembly to collect the light, and a spec- trograph with attached CCD to disperse and detect the photonic emissions. The timing of the whole system is facilitated by a waveform generator. One of the quality control steps within C2CA, is inspection of drill cores of concrete coming from the EOL building. Drill cores usually contain infor- mation on the type of materials used in the concrete (cement, sand, granulate, rebar), and the possible ingress of chlorines (in case of outside exposure) or degree of carbonation. The possibility to inspect drill cores and detect these properties in-situ consti- tutes an advance on present practices, since the dis- mantling and demolition process may be adapted according to the information to produce the highest quality secondary raw materials for recycling. The laboratory LIBS set-up has been shown to be sensitive enough to perform semi-quantitative surface mappings which enable visualization of el- emental distributions of various elements. Figure 13a shows the grayscale LIBS raster scanning results on one of the drill cores (no.7-from the pillar wall in the room 2.03 of the KB2 building) measured in the air compared with the photograph. Starting at the surface, the drilling core was linearly scanned. Each measurement was made per millimetre av- eraged over ten single laser shots. The distance between two lines was 1 mm. Each spectrum was Figure 9: Input contaminants and accepted and ejected output of NIR sensor sorting system. 324 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 10: Wind sifting facility in REDOX.

Ca (Ca 422.4 nm) was abundant in the cement paste, while the Si (288.1 nm) and Fe (274.4 nm) in aggregate and rebar, respectively. In particular, the inverse relation between the Ca and the Si content can be observed by the comparison between aggre- gate and cement. Si, Al (Al 309.1 nm), Fe, K (K 766.3 nm), Mg (Mg 285.0 nm), Li (Li 670.5 nm), Na (Na 589.0 nm), S (S 922.0 nm) were also present in cement paste. Furthermore, there was higher content of Si in the white (more like quartz) aggre- gate than that in the dark green aggregate and vice versa for Al and Na. C (C2 516.6 nm) was observed in both cement paste and rebar. O (O 777.2 nm) and H (H 656.3 nm) were mainly in aggregates, possibly as combined H 2 O. Cl (Cl 837.7 nm) was mainly detected in the dark green aggregate and rebar. It should be emphasized that the images show the relative distribution of the element, and not the absolute concentration. Comparison with the photograph of the scanned drill core surface proves that cement paste, coarse aggregate and re- bar were clearly differentiated. The finer gravel or sand could also be distinguished using higher scanning resolution. To facilitate the smart dismantling at earliest stage, it was attempted to differentiate between ag- gregate, cement paste and rebar of the drill cores us- number of particles ing LIBS. Successful classification of different types of aggregate, sand and cement paste, as well as re- bar using PCA and neural network algorithms were achieved (see Figure 13b). In addition the area ra- tios of the different materials could be determined (Figure 13c). Drill core concrete samples taken from the building site before demolition at the start of the C2CA project have been successfully categorized according to the used cement types. As a represen- tative of each group, drill core no. 7 (Portland) had a higher content of Ca while no. 15 (blast furnace slag cement, from the floor in the room 0.36 of the KB6 building) had higher contents of Si, Al, Fe and Mg (see Figure 14). Here, the LIBS signal intensity for each element is normalized to the summation over those of all elements and hence, is not pro- portional to its elemental content. These findings will be instrumental for smart dismantling, because it helps to determine which parts of the concrete structure may be demolished together and which parts should be kept separate to obtain concrete batches of known and consistent quality. The potential capability of the LIBS system to detect and characterize the waste pollutants in a real-scale setting has been investigated in (Xia, et al. 2014). The classification of eight waste materials with selected types from a stream of demolition concrete produced using their LIBS spectra com- bined with principal component analysis (PCA) is Figure 12: Laboratory LIBS experimental setup. 326 107 39 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 13: LIBS grid scanning 20 ⇥ 20 mm 2 on drill core no. 7 in 1 mm steps.

The representative materi- als for most of the materials found in demolition concrete were: cement (CEM I 42.5 R HS, CEM II/B-S 52.5 N, CEM III/B 32.5 N), brick (yellow, brown and red), gypsum block (white, blue and red), wood (pine, ash and walnut), PVC plastic (grey, black pipe and grey hard plate), glass (white, green and brown), two of the most common types of natural rock used as aggregate (sandstone and gabbro) and steel rebar, of which only one type is used in the Netherlands. All materials could be successfully classified out of a random (data) mix- ture of these materials using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). As a percentage of the tested data set, the misclassifications made up 0.28% (single-shot), 0.14% (2 fold averaged), 0.56% (4 fold averaged) and 0% (10 fold averaged). HSI Figure 14: Element-wise comparison of drill cores 7 and 15. Note that the y-axis adds up to unity for each element. An Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) approach, acting in the NIR range (1000-1700 nm) was adopted as quality control tool for the recovered products (i.e. recycled aggregates). More in detail, a system able to recognize concrete aggregates and unwanted contaminants, such as brick, wood, plastic, gypsum and foam after the ADR processing was developed, implemented and set up. Utilized HSI platform, realized by DV srl (Padova, Italy), is an integrated hardware and soft- ware architecture allowing to digitally capture and manage spectra, as they result along a pre-defined alignment on a surface sample properly energized (Hyvarinen, et al. 1998) and (Geladi, et al. 2007).Hy- perspectral data are called “hypercube” because of 327 Lotfi et al. Figure 15: PCA score plot of waste materials using the first three PCs. Indicated in the axis label is the PC contribution to the total variance. their 3D structure, characterized by two spatial and one spectral dimensions. For each pixel of the hy- perspectral image, a full discrete is obtained being the wavelength bands typically an equally spaced sequence (Geladi, et al. 2004). Spectral features are related to the chemical-physical properties of samples, allowing a full characterization. Spectral adsorption mechanisms usually affecting vegeta- tion, mineral, chemical products, etc. also affect secondary raw materials as generated in an Ur- ban Mining context. In this latter case alterations, due to “life-time” related constraints of both ma- terials and/or products, as well as, the frequent presence of “composite”, dramatically influence de- tected spectra characteristics, not allowing and easy identification of specific absorption features. Fur- thermore, man-made are a source, at the origins, of chemical absorptions which are not readily found in natural materials. Finally, weather alteration can modify the original material and as a consequence their spectra (Roberts, et al. 2004). For all these reasons, acquired spectra interpretation is difficult, but it is simply possible to relate most absorption bands to C-H, O-H and N-H stretching vibrations specific for the NIR range. Pollutant samples (i.e. wood, plastic, gypsum, brick and foam), provided from C2CA case study, were representative of some contaminant materials Figure 16: Digital image of Experimental set up 1 (a) and Experimental set up 2 (b). 328 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 17: Acquired spectra of the six different analysed materials. collected after demolition of a building in Gronin- gen (NL). RA samples are 4-16 mm ADR products. Analysed hyperspectral images were acquired in the 880-1720 nm wavelength range, with a spectral resolution of 7 nm, for a total of 121 wavelengths. In order to remove effects due to the background noise, a preliminary reduction of investigated wave- lengths was applied and spectral variables were thus reduced from 121 to 93. The investigated wave- length range was from 1006 nm to 1650 nm. The image width was 320 pixels, while the number of frames was variable according to the length of the desired acquisition. Two different hyperspectral image sequences have been thus acquired in order to build the clas- sification model and to validate it. A first and a second series, respectively identified as Experimen- tal set up 1 and the Experimental set up 2 (Figure 16). Twelve particles clearly identified as brick (2 particles), aggregates (3 particles), wood (1 particle), gypsum (3 particles), foam (3 particles) and plastic (4 particles) were arranged in lines, forming the Ex- perimental set up 1 used to build the classification model. Experimental set up 2 was used as valida- tion data set: particles were arranged in six groups according to their class membership. Looking at the acquired raw spectra (Figure 17) related to the Experimental set up 1, differences in the spectral behaviour are visible. In order to high- light them, a combination of three pre-processing algorithms (Detrend, Standard Normal Variate and Mean Center) is applied, the obtained spectra are shown in Figure 18. After pre-processing, Principal Component Anal- ysis (PCA) was applied to the image corresponding to the Experimental set up 1 in order to explore Figure 18: Pre-processed spectra of the six different analysed materials. 329 Lotfi et al. Figure 19: PCA score plot: Experimental set-up 1 pixels projection onto the space of PC1 vs PC2. the data. PCA projects the samples into a low dimensional subspace, whose axes (the principal components, PCs) point in the direction of maxi- mal variance, compressing the data. Looking at the distribution of samples into the PCs space, it is thus possible to interpret differences and similari- ties among them: the more they are grouped, the more they have similar spectral features. Further- more, PCA highlights the trends among samples, giving preliminary information about distribution of different specimen on an image (Amigo, et al. 2013). The obtained score plot is shown in Figure 19: six different clusters, corresponding to the differ- ent materials, are recognizable onto the score plot. Therefore the training dataset was easily created by removing some border cluster points “different” from all other spectra of the same category and by setting class of the remaining pixels. Partial Least-Square Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) was adopted in order to build a predictive model able to classify the different specimen in the image: recycled aggregates and contaminants. This technique is a linear method based on the partial least squares regression requiring prior data knowl- edge: it is a supervised classification. The PLS-DA model allows to assign to each unknown sample (in this case, pixel) only one of the available defined classes, according to the similarity among spectra. Prediction maps are PLS-DA results: each class is defined by a different colour. In Figure 20 PLS-DA prediction map of Experimental set up 2 is shown. A good classification is obtained and it is easy to associate each object in the image to a specific category, but some sporadic misclassified pixels are visible. This phenomenon can be attributed to the 330 rough surface of the samples and the consequent light scattering effect. Moreover, it is necessary to take in account the presence of dust particles, due to the “dirty” nature of the samples, that can influence the analysis because of their own spectrum. HSI based approach allows to develop an objec- tive, fast and non-destructive method in order to control the quality of ADR products. It is possible to discriminate between recycled aggregates and contaminants in the ADR outputs, evaluating the pollutant content in order to monitor the entire re- cycling process. The utilization of the proposed approach is preferred in the secondary raw mate- rials sector, where expensive and/or sophisticated quality control devices cannot be practically pro- posed, both for technical (i.e. particles of different size, shape and composition, etc.) and economic (i.e. environmental constraints, maintenance, etc.) reasons. VII. Conclusions According to the results the following conclusions can be drawn out: • Smart dismantling and selective demolition is the most important step to minimize con- taminants in RA. Results show that although the wood content of 4-16 mm recycled aggre- gates is well within the strictest limit of the EU standard, the still visible pieces of wood and plastic in the +16 mm RA fraction reduces the economic potential of the RA. Using selective demolition in this study, the amount of gyp- sum and wood in the crushed EOL concrete 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 20: Prediction map based on PLS-DA model built for the classification of foam (1), gypsum (2), wood (3), aggregates (4), brick (5) and plastic (6) in the Experimental set up 2. was reduced to almost 60 ppm and 2 cm 3 /kg respectively. • Autogenous milling reduces the mass percent- age of contaminants bigger than 5mm by 30%. There is a clear effect of the milling on the size reduction of brick. A similar trend can be seen for wood contaminants but in a less outstanding way. • The amount of wood in 4-16mm ADR product was measured as 0.117 cm 3 /kg which is well within the strictest norm of EU standard. • It is revealed that the combination of two tech- nologies (NIR sensor sorting and wind sifting) will remove most of the contaminants from +16 mm RA. • Two developing sensors (LIBS and HSI), should allow on-line methods for quality control and quality assurance of the concrete recycling products. The concept is to avoid the need for laboratory analysis and intermediate stor- age and if possible quality and end- of-waste certification at the site without human inter- vention. Recent investigations related to the aforesaid sensors show their high potential to- wards achieving the mentioned goals.

Box 49, 2600 AA Delft, The Netherlands Abstract Cement based mortars are widely used as adhesive for tiles in building and construction. They have a limited timespan during which a tile can be placed effectively in order to develop sufficient bond strength. This timespan, usually called ’open time’, is controlled, amongst others, by adding water soluble polymers such as methyl cellulose or modified cellulose ether like methylhydroxy-ethylcellulose (MHEC) to the mortar. MHEC influences the drying behavior of the mortar. As such, it may be expected to influence the final microstructure of the tiling mortar. The paper reports the results of a combined scanning electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging study on the development of the microstructure of hardening mortar. Keywords: : tiling mortar, methylhydroxy-ethylcellulose, PFM, SEM, NMR I. Introduction Cementitous tiling mortars are widely used in the building and construction industry to apply ce- ramic tiles on walls etc. Besides cement, water and aggregate, such tiling mortars usually contain ad- ditives like methylhydroxy-ethylcellulose (MHEC). MHEC is a water soluble cellulose ether, synthe- sized from cellulose by substituting methyl and ethylene oxide groups by an etherification process. Such water soluble polymers are added to control the so-called ’open time’, i.e. the limited timespan during which a tile can be placed effectively in or- der to develop sufficient bond strength. Though several studies have been published on the effect of MHEC on kinetics of cement hydration (Müller 2006, Pourchez 2006), water retention, transport and microstructure (Pourchez et al. 2010, Wetzel et al. 2011, Marliere et al. 2012), viscosity (Faiyas et al. 2015) and skin formation (Bühler et al. 2013), the working principle and effect of MHEC on the de- velopment of materials properties of tiling mortars is still not properly understood. The current study focusses on the effect of MHEC on the microstruc- ture development of tile mortars by a combination of optical polarizing-and-fluorecence microscopy (PFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR). In order to get a better understanding of the effect of MHEC, the following samples have been studied: 1) The effect of the presence of MHEC on the mi- crostructure of cement paste and mortar in closed systems. 2) The influence of increasing MHEC con- tent on the air void content of the hardened mi- crostructure in closed systems, studied by optical microscopy and NMR, and 3) The relationship be- tween the presence of MHEC on microstructure and drying behaviour in open and closed systems, stud- ied by optical and scanning electron microscopy and NMR. II. Sample preparation Cement paste samples for experiment 1 Cement pastes were made with CEM I 52.5R only. Pastes were made with 0 and 0.5 wt.% MHEC. A commercial grade MHEC (Tylose MHS 300000 P6) provided by SE Tylose GmbH & Co.KG, Germany, with a degree of substitution (DSME, ME=Methyl) of 1.3 and a molar degree of substitution (MSHE, HE=Hydroxyethyl) of 0.3 was used. Cement pastes were prepared according to the following procedure: cement and the MHEC pow- der were mixed in a plastic cup for two minutes and subsequently 34 wt. % of water was added to the mixture. The sample was carefully stirred for 30 seconds and after one minute the sample was again 333 Faiyas et al. Figure 1: Plane polarized light microphotographs of cement pastes (upper row) and mortars (lower row) with 0 wt.% MHEC (left) and 0.5 wt.% MHEC. stirred for one minute. After five minute, stirring was performed for 15 seconds. Finally the cement was put in to cylindrical Teflon tube with 18 mm diameter and 10 mm length and the Teflon Tube is sealed to avoid any evaporation. Mortar samples for experiment 1 The dry composition for mortar samples for experi- ment 2 was the following: 38 wt.% CEM I 52.5R, 57 wt.% quartz sand, 5 wt.% limestone filler and 0 or 0.5 wt.% MHEC. The MHEC was similar as those used for the cement pastes. Mortar paste samples were prepared according to the following procedure: the dry components were mixed in a plastic cup for two minutes and subsequently 34 wt.% of water was added to the mixture. The sample was carefully stirred for 30 seconds and after one minute the sample was again stirred for one minute. After five minute, stirring was performed for 15 seconds. Finally, the mortar was put in to cylindrical Teflon tube with 18 mm diameter and 10 mm length and the Teflon Tube is sealed to avoid any evaporation. Mortar samples for experiments 2 and 3 Mortars for experiments 1 and 3 have the following dry composition: 38 wt.% CEM I 52.5 R, 57 wt.% quartz sand, 5 wt.% limestone filler. MHEC con- centrations were varied from 0, 0.21, 0.5, 2.1 and 4.3 wt.% MHEC relative to water. A commercial grade MHEC (Tylose MHS 6000 P6) provided by 334 SE Tylose GmbH & Co.KG, Germany was used in experiments 1 and 3. This MHEC has a degree of substitution (DSME, ME=Methyl) of 1.3 and a molar degree of substitution (MSHE, HE=Hydroxyethyl) of 0.3. Mortars were prepared according to the follow- ing procedure: the dry components were mixed in a plastic cup for two minutes and subsequently 23 wt.% of water was added to the mixture. The sam- ple was carefully stirred for 30 seconds and after one minute the sample was again stirred for one minute. After five minute, stirring was performed for 15 seconds. Finally the mortar was put in to cylindrical Teflon tube with 18 mm diameter and 10 mm length and the Teflon Tube is sealed to avoid any evaporation or left open (part of the samples in experiment 3). III. Experimental details Microscopic methods Thin sections for optical microscopy were made and investigated according to procedures outlined in Nijland & Larbi (2010). Scanning electron mi- croscopy (SEM) was performed using a FEI Nova Nanosem 630 with solid state (GAD) and secondary electron (SE) detectors and energy dispersive spec- trometeres. This type of SEM allows for the use of uncoated samples. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR principle - Nuclei with a net magnetic mo- ment (such as 1 H, 23 Na, 35 Cl, 19 F and 6 Li etc..) will start to precess, when placed in a magnetic field with a resonance frequency, called Larmor frequency ( f l ) and is given by, f l = g B 0 2p (1) g where 2p is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei (42.58 MHz/T for hydrogen nuclei), and B 0 is the applied magnetic field strength. To the constant magnetic field B 0 , a spatially varying magnetic field B can be applied to introduce position dependency, B = B 0 + ( G · x ) , (2) where G is the magnetic field gradient and x the position. This enables in-situ monitoring of moisture content at different positions in the sample since the resonance frequency varies as a function of position. The sum of all individual magnetic moment is called the net macroscopic magnetization, and can be manipulated by applying an oscillating magnetic field B 1 exactly at the resonance frequency of the nuclei. The intensity of the resulting spin echo sig- nal is proportional to the density of the magnetic moment and thus the hydrogen or water concen- tration at different positions. Besides the proton density also information about the interaction of the spins can be obtained. In principle the intensity of the spin echo decay is given by S = S 0 exp ( nt E ) T 2 (3) wherein S 0 is the intensity of the signal, T 2 the spin-spin relaxation time and t E the echo time. Surface relaxation - During an NMR measurement, water molecules inside a pore with a volume V and an internal surface area S, move randomly due to Brownian motion and probe the pore structure. This will influence the T 2 relaxation time, which contains information on the pore size distribution of the porous material. Depending on the pore size distribution various surface relaxation time can be identified. In the fast diffusion limit (Brownstein & Tarr 1979), where pores are so small that a typi- cal molecule crosses the pore surface many times before it relaxes in the bulk, the surface relaxation rate is given by 1 1 S = + r s T 2,s T 2,b V (4) where r s is the surface relativity, which is a con- sequence of the susceptibility difference between the water and the porous material. V S is the surface to volume ratio of the pore, and T 2,b is the bulk relaxation time, which is negligible compared to surface relaxation time (T 2,b » T 2,S ). NMR setup - The experiments were performed with a home built NMR setup with a static magnetic field of 0.7 T, resulting a resonance frequency value of 31.57 MHz and a gradient of 400 mT/m, with a theoretical spatial resolution of 0.8 mm. Moisture profiles were obtained by using a Hahn spin echo sequence at different sample positions, divided by Figure 2: Cross polarized light microphotographs of cement pastes (upper row) and mortars (lower row) with 0 wt.% MHEC (left) and 0.5 wt.% MHEC. 335 Faiyas et al. 5.5 0.24 5.0 Cement cement +0.5 Wt % MHEC 4.5 0.20 0.5 wt % MHEC 0 wt % MHEC 4.0 0.5 wt % MHEC 0 wt % MHEC 0.16 S(t) 3.5 T 2 (ms) cement +0.5 wt % MHEC 3.0 2.5 2.0 0.12 0.08 1.5 cement 1.0 0.04 0.5 0.0 0.00 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 t(h) t(h) 30 40 50 Figure 3: T 2 (left) and signal (right) evolution of cement paste with and without 0.5 wt.% MHEC in a closed system as function of time. the reference sample of equal volume. Spin–spin relaxation time (T 2 ) values are obtained by conven- tional CPMG pulse sequences. The NMR set up is designed to measure moisture profile of cylindri- cal samples. A step motor is used to position the sample inside NMR setup. Mercury intrusion porosimetry The pore size distribution of the dried samples was measured by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The pore size distribution from MIP is depending on the pore geometry, since MIP only measures the connected pores. IV. Results Experiment 1: Effect of the presence of MHEC on microstructure of cement paste and mortar Figure 1 shows an overview of the microstructure of cement paste and mortar with an without 0.5 wt.% MHEC. From the pictures, it becomes clear that, with the same preparation method, addition of MHEC to both cement paste and mortar results in considerably more entrapped air and by conse- quence a significantly more porous microstructure. Addition also has a profound effect on the mor- phology of portlandite crystals (aggregates), which become larger, more developed, and in case of the cement paste seem to exhibit some kind of regu- lar distribution pattern (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows NMR relaxation curves and signal curves. The sig- nal curves shows the amount of water being present in a free state. The signal level drop is the result of hydration process ongoing. Clearly in both cases the signal loss in approximately the same, indicat- ing a similar hydration curve. The T 2 curves show a higher T 2 value, which indicates larger pores, which seems to be in line with the observation of more air being entrapped in the mortar. The same observations holds for Figure 4. However, the key difference seems to be in the larger delay in hydra- 14 0.30 0 wt % MHEC 0.5 wt % MHEC 12 0 wt % MHEC 0.5 wt % MHEC 0.25 10 8 S(-) T 2 (ms) 0.20 6 0.15 0.10 4 0.05 2 0 0.00 0 5 10 15 20 t(h) 25 30 35 40 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 t(h) Figure 4: T 2 (left) and signal (right) evolution of mortars with and without 0.5 wt.% MHEC in a closed system as function of time. 336 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands 8 0.35 0 wt % MHEC 0.21 wt % MHEC 0.4 wt % MHEC 2.1 wt % MHEC 3.4 wt % MHEC 7 5 0.30 0.25 0.20 4 S(-) T 2 (ms) 6 0 wt % MHEC 0.21 wt % MHEC 0.4 wt % MHEC 2.1 wt % MHEC 3.4 wt % MHEC 3 0.10 2 0.05 1 0 0.15 0 5 10 t(h) 15 20 25 0.00 0 5 10 15 20 25 t(h) Figure 6: NMR T 2 evolution (left) and signal (right) of tile mortars with increasing MHEC content in a closed system as a function of time. tion (shift of T 2 curve to the right in case of presence of MHEC), and a increase and decrease signal at 3 hours is observed in the signal curves. Experiment 2: Increasing MHEC content and air void content of mortar Figure 5 shows overview of the microstructure of the tile mortars with increasing MHEC content in a closed system. As in experiment 1 (Figure 1), addi- tion of MHEC results in a considerable amount of Figure 5: Microphotograph with overview of the mi- crostructure of tile mortars with increasing MHEC con- tent (Tylose MHS 6000 P6) in a closed system: 0 wt.% (top left), 0.21 wt.% (middle left), 0.4 wt.% (bottom left), 1.3 wt.% (top right), 2.1 wt.% (middle right) and 3.4 wt.% (bottom right). entrapped air and porous microstructure. There is no clear relationship between MHEC content and the amount of air voids for mortars with 0.4 wt.% MHEC or more (Figure 5). Corresponding T 2 re- laxation time and signal evolution versus time as determined by NMR (Figure 6) show an increase in T 2 for mortars with 0.4 wt.% MHEC or more in the period up to 12 hours; the mortars with MHEC show lower signal intensity than the one without MHEC present. With increasing concentration of MHEC the hydration is delayed, until a concentra- tion of 2.1 wt% is reached, after which the delay does not increase. The results of these experiments are comparable with the results during experiment 1. Note that the viscosity of the first experiment was much higher at similar concentrations. Figure 7: Complete cross section of mortars without (left) and with 0.5 wt.% MHEC (right) in a closed system (plane polarized light). 337 Faiyas et al. Figure 8: Plane polarized light microphotographs of the microstructure of mortars with 0.5 wt.% MHEC in an open (left) and closed (right) system. Experiment 3: Effect of MHEC on microstructure and drying behaviour in open and closed systems Figure 7 shows the complete cross sections of sam- ples used for the NMR experiments in a closed system. In line with the other experiments, the ad- dition of MHEC again results in more entrapped air and a considerably more porous microstructure, as far as macropores (air voids) are concerned. Fur- thermore no depth dependence is observed. Figure 8 shows the microstructure of mortars hardened in open and closed systems. On the scale visible by optical microscopy, no differences are visible. Contrary to optical microscopy, SEM shows dif- ferences in microstructure in case of drying mortars in an open system both with and without MHEC. In the zone below the drying surfaces, similar mi- crostructures are observed (Figure 9, top left and right). However, within the mortar with 0.5 wt.% MHEC, there is a clear variation of microstructure as a function of depth, showing less cohesion in the middle (in the zone of the receding drying front; Figure 9 bottom left) and a more well developed microstructure with well developed ettringite at the bottom (Figure 9 bottom right). This is con- firmed by pore size distributions obtained by MIP (Figure 10). These show a slight shift to smaller pore sizes, but still the major peak is close to 1 µm for the middle of the sample. The bottom of the sample shows a bimodal pore size distribution, in which the amount pores around 1 µm is reduced and a second peak around 0.1 µm appears (Fig- ure 10). In Figure 11, the pore size distributions obtained by MIP for mortars drying in open and closed systems are compared. The pore sizes in the mortars from closed systems are considerably smaller than those found in the open systems, re- gardless whether MHEC is present or not (Figure 11). When MHEC is present in the open system a shift is observed to smaller pore sizes, but the sys- tem still contains a considerable amount of larger pores. The reason for obtaining smaller pores in the 338 open system in presence of MHEC can be explained based on the MRI profiles made for the drying sys- tems. Figure 12 shows the moisture distribution of drying mortars in an open system with different cellulose concentration as function of position. The moisture profile of 0 wt.% MHEC mortar initially shows shrinkage (indicated by horizontal arrow in Figure 12a) due to evaporation, i.e. the mortar compacts, but otherwise the water is distributed homogeneously (indicated by the vertical arrow) till the end of the process. The moisture profile of the mortar with 0.4 wt.% MHEC also shows a homogeneous distribution of water initially; below a moisture content of about 0.10 (m 3 /m 3 ), the water distribution becomes slightly inhomogeneous. At higher MHEC concentrations of 1.3 (Figure 12c) and 2.1 wt.% (Figure 12d), a clear drying front develops at the surface; simultaneous to the ingress, the wa- Figure 9: SEM microphotographs with overview of the microstructure in mortar without (top left) and with 0.5 wt% MHEC at the surface (top right), half the cross section (bottom left) and at the bottom (bottom right) in closed system. 9: SEM microphotographs with of the on microstructure mortar to without (top Materials left) and with 0.5 wt% 15 th overview Euroseminar Microscopy in Applied Building • 17-19 June MHEC 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands at the surface (top right), half the cross section (bottom left) and at the bottom (bottom right) in closed system. the addition of MHEC to mortar or cement paste has an influence on the portlandite morphology. As a consequence SEM images were made. These SEM observations on the mortar with 0.5 wt.% MHEC (open system) show relatively large booklets of port- landite (Figure 13) with a nanostructured surface (Figure 14). EDS analysis confirms the presence of an organic compound in these booklets (Figure 15), indicating coprecipitation of portlandite and MHEC. 0.016 Incremental pore volume (ml/g) 0.014 unsealed 0 wt % MHEC mortar unsealed 2.1 MHEC mortar middle unsealed 2.1 MHEC mortar bottom 0.012 0.010 0.008 0.006 0.004 0.002 0.000 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 V.

This receding drying front seems to correspond to the change in microstructure in the vertical cross section Page observed 9 of 12 by SEM. The rea- son for that is that due to the presence of MHEC a receding front forms, which results in a longer presence of water at the bottom of the sample. The top of the sample will dry first. As a result of this increased retention of water with increasing depth in the sample, the time of hydration will also in- crease with depth in the sample. The longer time of hydration at the bottom of the sample will increase the degree of hydration and as a consequence of the larger formation of hydration products the pore size will decrease. As can be clearly seen from the SEM pictures and MIP measurements. In experiment 1 optical microscopy showed that shows a clear effect of the addition of MHEC on both the porosity / pore structure of the hardened mortar and cement paste, as well as portlandite morphology. The amount of entrapped air and with that macro-pores is significantly increased when MHEC is added (Figure 1, 5, 7). At the same time, addition of MHEC causes a shift in the average pore size, forming a bimodal pore size distribu- tion in which a larger amount of small pores are formed (Figures 10, 11). This observation holds for both open and closed systems having MHEC. In open systems, this shift in pore size distribution is accompanied by the development of a receding dry- ing front at higher MHEC concentrations (Figure 12). Due to the higher viscosity of the pore fluid it cannot maintain homogenous drying towards the surface anymore; Consequently, in the upper part, evaporation occurs and less water is available for hydration, where as the part of the mortar be- low the drying front, develops the micro- and pore Incremental Pore Volume (ml/g) 0.020 0 wt % MHEC unsealed mortar 2.1 wt % MHEC unsealed mortar 0 wt % MHEC sealed mortar 2.1 wt % MHEC sealed mortar 0.015 0.010 0.005 0.000 0.01 0.1 1 Pore diameter ( μ ) 10 100 Figure 11: The influence of MHEC on the pore size distribution of sealed and unsealed mortar with and without 2.1 wt.% MHEC. 339 Faiyas et al. 0.35 0.30 a b 0.30 0.25 0.25 0.15 ) ) Θ ( 0.20 0.20 0.10 Θ ( 0.15 0.10 Bottom Topp 0.05 0.05 0.00 0.30 -2 0 2 4 6 8 X(mm) 10 12 0.00 -2 0 2 4 6 X(mm) 8 10 12 8 10 12 0.30 c d 0.20 0.20 ) ) 0.25 0.25 Θ ( Θ ( 0.15 0.15 0.10 0.10 0.05 0.05 0.00 -2 0 2 4 6 X(mm) 8 10 12 0.00 -2 0 2 4 6 X(mm) Figure 12: NMR Moisture profile of unsealed mortar samples with 0 (a), 0.4 (b), 1.3 (c) and 2.1 (d) wt.% MHEC. 0 and 0.4 wt % MHEC the profiles have been plotted every 12 minutes and 1.3 and 2.1 wt % MHEC profiles have been plotted every 24 minutes.

MHEC clearly adsorb on the portlandite surface (Figure 14, 15), a phenomenon observed in previous studies by non-microscopic techniques (e.g. Ou et al. 2012). This adsorption is probably responsible for the observed change in portlandite morphology (Figures 2, 13).

Matziaris S.A., 570 11 Thessaloniki, Greece ⇤ e-mail: stefan@civil.auth.gr Abstract Even though low fired clay bricks provide energy saving to masonry structures, water lies in wait on their physical and chemical degradation. In an effort to protect them from water and its effects on their degradation, different solutions have been tested both commercial and nano-modified. Brick samples in cubic shapes (4 ⇥ 4 ⇥ 4cm) were immersed for 2 minutes duration in coating solutions and then left to dry for 7 days in normal conditions (20 C, R.H. 65%). The water repellence effectiveness has been tested by means of capillarity, porosity, water absorption, static contact angle (SCA) and micro-roughness measurements. Since documented by numerous researchers that surface roughness is strongly related to hydrophobicity, we focused to sample’s profilometry and furthermore the penetration depth of protective coatings has been visualized and evaluated by means of acoustic microscopy measurements. Acoustic signals on the material interfaces have been transformed and depicted in order to eliminate unpleasant noise, attributing the impregnated mineral surface relief. The derived results showed that all the coatings exhibit high penetrability and sufficient protection against moisture deterioration. Eventually, it seems that acoustic microscopy is a powerful non- destructive technique that contributes to the evaluation of water repellency treatments in mineral substrates. Keywords: brick, water-repellent, acoustic microscopy, capillarity, porosity I. Introduction Bricks are porous materials and they are susceptible to deterioration. Water presence, in any status like: humidity, rain, capillary absorption, water vapour condensation, causes the most important patholo- gies in constructions (Watt, 2000). As a result take place material’s degradation and downgrading of their initial characteristics (Foraboschi, 2014). Dif- ferent protection measures either on the building itself or on its environment have been applied in order to restrict the problem. Traditional materi- als that were used to impregnate the surface of building materials were organic substances such as waxes and oils (Mac Mullena, 2011) (Nunes, 2014) while waterproof clay was reported as protective measure in some cases (Binks, 2005). The evolution of technology had as a result the production of a wide variety of materials with water-proof proper- ties (Simionescu, 2009) (Castellino, 2011) (Esteves, 2014). Fired bricks are some of the most primeval and re- silient building materials and have been used since around 3000 BC (Stefanidou, 2014). Clay bricks have an impressively high load-bearing capacity while keeping high dimensional stability and com- pressive strength. All the mentioned characteristics minimize the risk of cracking, ensuring the struc- tural integrity of buildings. Bricks absorb and store heat throughout the day, and then slowly release it at night, including thermal mass to buildings. Consequently, bricks offer lower energy consump- tion, due to reduced costs for heating and cooling. Salt presence, discoloration, biological alteration, degradation, swelling and dissolution are some of the symptoms bricks can present due to water ac- 343 Stefanidou et al. tion (Larsen, 1990) (Morton, 1990). Many studies have been reported in an effort to protect bricks especially those incorporated in monuments and historic buildings with special value in the cultural heritage and different techniques have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments (Ste- fanidou, 2013) (Carrascosa, 2014). In the present paper silicon-based water proof products have been applied by the impregnation technique in specially produced bricks used for conservation purposes. The difference of these bricks in relation to indus- try made ones, is the fact that they were produced hand–made according to compatibility principles based on the analysis of old bricks (Papayianni, 1998). Thus, their porosity is high the compressive strength and specific gravity is low in relation to industrially produced bricks. The special character- istics that these bricks have, renders them expensive. Their protection and the extension of their service life are important for the sustainability and econ- omy of the intervention works. II. Experimental part Materials and methods Clay brick samples have been prepared by labo- ratory methods according to monument restora- tion demands from a clay matrix paste with main salts consistency as shown in Table 1. Clay moulds have been prepared and after natural drying all samples have been fired at temperature lower than 1000 C, imitating old traditional practices. Finally bricks have been cut by laser machinery in cubical shapes with dimensions 4 ⇥ 4 ⇥ 4cm. The mineralogi- cal composition has determined by XRD analysis as shown in Figure 1. The colour of the brick samples have been characterized by use of Munsel chart as 2.5YR5/6 red. For the protective coatings synthesis has been selected a commercial product based on triethoxy (2,4,4-trimethyl-pentyl) silane that was diluted in heavy naptha (mixture proportion 1:10 parts w/w). The diluted solution has been divided into 2 parts and the first part left as it described (coded S) and the second (coded SN) was enriched by the addition 1% w/w of hydrophobic silicon dioxide nanopar- ticles (14nm diameter) with BET 200 ± 25m 2 /g and the above mentioned nano-modified coating was combined with micro-clay addition to 1% w/w. The added micro-clay is fine grained and it is used for pottery. The gradation of clay was recorded by par- ticle size analysis (Mastersizer2000 Scirroco). More- over 90% of the sample was below 400µm, while 50% of the sample was below 65µm and finally 10% was below 5.5µm. The added nanoparticles have been dispersed by ultrasound bath for 60 minutes. Brick samples 344 were immersed into solutions for 2 minutes dura- tion. Totally five series of samples were tested and all recorded values represent the mean average of these measurements. Note that in each case an un- treated sample was used for comparison reasons. All impregnated samples were left for 7 days under normal conditions (20 C, R.H. 65%) till solvent’s evaporation. In order to interpret hygric properties of the treated low fired clay bricks in comparison to the untreated samples porosity and water absorption capacity of the samples have been tested accord- ing to RILEM CPC11.3 recommendations on water absorption under vacuum (RILEM, 1984). Further- more capillarity absorption and the capillary index were recorded based on EN1015-18 regulation espe- cially useful for determination of water absorption coefficient due to capillary action of hardened mor- tars (BS EN 1015-18, 2002). The capillary forces are determined by: the surface tension of the liquid, the contact angle between the liquid and the pore walls, and the radius of the pores. Narrow pores attract moisture stronger (higher) than wide pores are able to do. A viscous liquid is less quickly at- tracted, than a thinner one. Small contact angles indicate molecular attraction between the liquid and the solid substrate. A liquid drop spreads over a flat surface; the meniscus in a capillary lies above the level of the surrounding liquid and is hollow towards the “dry” side. In the absence of such attraction between a solid substance and a liquid, a drop remains on the surface in the form of a sphere and high values of the angle are recorded. The hydrophobicity of the treated surface has been evaluated by Static Contact Angle (SCA) measured by means of a goniometer Kruss DSA 100 with the special fitted software Drop Shape Analysis. The penetration depth was tested by our laboratory empirical protocol based on macroscopically mea- surements of penetration depth. The cut samples of bricks have been cleaned by acetone and then have been dried for 24 hours at normal climatic con- ditions (25 C and 50% R.H.). Samples have been immersed for 5 minutes into the measured to be solution. For curing and development of hydropho- bicity, samples are stored for 7 days. Afterwards samples are wetted with water. The hydrophobic zone does not absorb the water but remains light and does not change appearance. The untreated, inner area, is not water repellent, absorbs water and becomes darker. So the hydrophobic zone can be measured (i.e. with a ruler or vernier calipers) or it can be documented by taking a picture. The macroscopic results of penetration depth have been combined by Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) in order to visualize inside the very thin protec- tive film mass, the micro to nanoscale structure of the mineral clay bricks and the organosilanic 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Table 1: Clay matrix water soluble salts average consistency.

Acoustic Microscopy is an in- novative, non-destructive technique, by using very high frequency ultrasounds. It helps to superficial and internal features visualization of solid samples. Generally fewer scientists are familiar with this tech- nique because it involves more complex processes that require greater specialization and training for test operation and results interpretation. However, acoustic microscopy gives some advantages com- pared to other available technologies that make it superior as a tool for some materials and processes, e.g. artifacts diagnosis (Briggs, 1995) (Briggs, 1996) (Karagiannis, 2009) medical applications etc. The ultrasonic waves are emitted from the transducer into the measured sample through the used cou- pling medium. Since ultrasound propagates from the transducer to subject, echoes are generated by the interfaces of the various micro-structures. An echo is the reflective component of the initially gen- erated wave. The density of the reflection depends on the difference of the acoustic impedances of the engaged materials. The acoustic impedance is defined by: Z o = p · c (1) where p is the density of a medium and c is the velocity of sound into this medium. Therefore practically total reflection appears into material in- terfaces, which have different acoustic impedance, while wave reflection turns to minimal when two materials/media have similar acoustic impedance. The echoes are received by the transducer at differ- ent time instances, i.e., time of flight (TOF), which are proportional to the distance of the interfaces from the transducer. The signal that contains the echoes is called the A-Scan signal. Acoustic mi- croscopy allows the roughness measurement of a micro scale surface. To find the roughness from acoustic measurements (A-Scans) it needs to cal- culate the time of flight of the acoustic wave from the time it was produced until the time the first re- flected echo is received from the transducer (RILEM, 1979) BS EN1015-18, 2002). The procedure is shown in Figure 5. This is accomplished by gating the A-Scans in a time interval which is related to wave return. The calculation of Time of Flight (TOF) re- Table 2: Physical properties of the tested samples.

In or- der to calculate the roughness, the two dimensional Fourier Transform is used, X ( w 1 , w 2 ) = N 1 1 N 2 1 Â Â n 1 = 0 n 2 = 0 x [ n 1 , n 2 ] e j ( w 1 · n 1 + w 1 · n 2 ) (2) where x[n 1 ,n 2 ] is an image of size N 1 ⇥ N 2 and X ( w 1 , w 2 ) is the resulted Fourier transform. Espe- cially the surface roughness of the samples was measured using a profilometer (Mitutoyo) and R a values were calculated. The roughness of the sam- ples have a detrimental role in hydrophobicity as it enhances hydrophobicity of a solid surface lead- ing to high contact angles with water (Nosonovsky, 2007). In this case R a value which is a parameter that characterizes the surface based on the vertical deviations of the roughness profile from the mean line is recorded. R a is the arithmetic average of the absolute values. In order to check results, some preparation tests have been conducted for compare both results. III. Results and discussions Capillary and porosity tests The physical characteristics recorded in the samples are shown in Table 2. The silicone coating (S) im- posed a better behaviour in relation to the untreated samples both to capillary index and to water ab- sorption test. The nanosilica modified coating (SN) showed even better behaviour in the above tested parameters. The capillary absorption trend indi- cates (Figure 2) that treated with S samples after a certain time increase the quantity of the absorbed water but it still remains low comparing to the un- treated samples. The lowest absorption is recorded in samples treated with SN coatings. Static Contact Angle (SCA) test The water drop test results are tabulated in Table 3. The untreated sample absorbed water droplets al- most immediately and no values could be reported. This phenomenon occurs when a porous building material such as low fired clay brick comes into contact with (liquid) water, because water is sucked immediately into pores by capillary forces. The best hydrophobic behaviour was recorded by SN coating, shown characteristic images (Figure 3). Penetration depth-roughness The protocol measured penetration depth indicates that samples with S coating have a depth of almost 346 Table 3: Water drop angles measured on the surfaces of the samples. Sample Untreated sample S SN Contact Angle ( ) 0 109.8 137.0 3.75mm (Figure 4a), while SN coating reached an average penetration depth of 8.66mm (Figure 4b). The results are shown in Table 4. It seems that the roughness was increased after treatment with S solution but the NS solution made a considerable difference and a rather rough surface was achieved. Acoustic Microscopy Measurements The configuration followed for the measurements were: • Transducer: 110MHz • Scanning Area: 1 ⇥ 1 mm • Scanning Step: 0.01 ⇥ 0.01 mm • Sampling Rate: 500MHz • ABS Gate: 7-8.1 µsec • Coupling Medium: Deionized Water The images of roughness for three samples and the respective 2D-Fourier are illustrated in Figure 6. The 2D Fourier Transforms show that the rough- ness is limited in sample S and NS comparing with the untreated sample. Also, S sample show less roughness that NS which is in agreement with the results of the profilometer. Moreover, according to the dominating values of Fourier Transforms, it can be said that the untreated sample has alterations in the whole spectrum, i.e., 50 alterations/mm, whereas, S appears roughness from 0 to 15 alter- ations/mm and NS from 0 to 30 alteration/mm. To point that, as it was waited, roughness is in- dependent of the spatial dimension. The acoustic transmittance in a material is related to its acoustic impedance. In order this material behavior to be recognized, it needs to examine the C-Scans (3D representation of the measurement). Longitudinal sections of samples’ C-Scans are illustrated in Fig- ure 7.

Figure 3: Water drop angles measured on the surfaces of the samples. Figure 4: Macroscopic calculation of the penetration depth 347 Stefanidou et al. Figure 5: Photos during measurements It is shown that S solution allows an acoustic wave to be transmitted, but less than the untreated sample, whereas, NS solution does not allow the wave to be transmitted or the transmitted power is significantly reduced compared to the untreated sample. To quantify these results, the A-Scans of every measurement will be processed. Specifically, we want to measure the depth a wave travels into the material. This is realized by monitoring the am- plitude of the wave. When the time during which the amplitude of wave’s envelop is larger than a threshold is considered as the effective duration of Figure 6: 3D representation of the roughness (above) and 2D Fourier images. 348 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 7: Longitudinal sections of a) untreated sample, b) of samples treated with S and c) of samples treated with SN. the wave. Finally, for the mean effective duration among all A-Scans of a measurement is calculated. The threshold can be a ratio of maximum value of the wave, in this case, one hundredth. Also, to mention, that A-Scans are low pass filtered in order to eliminate noise artifacts. The envelop (s env ( t ) ) of a signal (s ( t ) ) is calculated as following; s a ( t ) = s ( t ) + jHT {( t )} (3) s env ( t ) = | s a ( t )| (4) where HT { . } is the Hilbert Transform. The Mean Effective Durations (MED) of the three samples and the relative MED according to the used Figure 8: Measuring Effective Duration of an echo by monitoring its envelop. Illustration of the operation in an arbitrary A-Scan. 349 Stefanidou et al. Table 5: Values of the MED for the three samples. Sample Untreated sample S SN MED (µsec) 0.5697 0.4128 0.158 time window are as shown in Table 5. The resulted MED values offer indirect informa- tion about the acoustic impedance of the materials. The fact that the MED of reference sample is large means that water has been absorbed in some depth during the measurement, allowing the coupling of acoustic wave for more time. About S treated samples, the MED indicates less transmittance, hence more reflectance. This means that the wave found a surface between two of differ- ent impedance materials. Consequently, the more different the materials, the more the reflectance. These two materials can be considered as the resin absorption region and the non absorption one. The resin has changed the mechanical properties of the material, making it more compact, so less resistive to acoustic waves. On the other hand, the more porous non absorption region is more resistive to acoustic waves. As a result, the common surface of these two different materials reflects very strongly the wave, not allowing it to travel in depth. Moreover, about NS treated samples, the same wave transition principle governs the results. In this case, the wave is transmitted more, so the inter- mediate surface between resin/non-resin regions is less definite. This means that the resin in this case made the region where was absorbed less compact comparing with NS. Initially the testing results starting from our em- pirical laboratory protocol shows that the penetra- tion depth varies by type of protective coatings and strongly depend on its additives (nano or micro). Furthermore profilometry is confirming that each coating exhibits high penetrability and sufficient protection against moisture deterioration. In addi- tion to our findings acoustic microscopy visualizes the interfaces in micro and nano scale between the organosilanic coating and the crystal brick surface. Hereby, confirmed the evaluation of water repel- lency treatments in mineral substrates. IV. Conclusion The brick samples have been impregnated by use of an organosilanic coating that furthermore this coat- ing was enriched with the addition of 1.5% w/w nanosilica and 1% w/w micro-clay. The achieved physical properties comparing to the untreated sam- ples show a significant improvement of all the brick protection parameters. Additionally all test have 350 shown that the nano and micro addition conducted to a deeper penetration of the coating, thus result- ing higher hydrophobicity, endorsed by higher SCA test results. In other words less water was absorbed either by capillary size porous or water absorption under vacuum. This phenomenon is related to the roughness’s increase, which was achieved on the surface of the bricks when they were treated with nano and micro protrusions. The roughness in- crease was recorded individually by profilometer measurements and also by the acoustic microscopy technique. Furthermore into our study has been revealed the practical contribution of acoustic microscopy to the surface study of the mineral profiles. A simple pro- filometer measurement is extrapolated from micro- sizing analysis with the incorporation of scanning acoustic microscopy to a full nano-scale visualiza- tion of the mineral and organosilanic compound interface area. As well measuring the Effective Du- ration of an echo, could give us conclusions for the material’s compactness, the internal structure, micro fragments, pore mapping etc., thus giving indirect information on the penetration depth of the protecting coatings. Conclusively acoustic mi- croscopy seems to be a very powerful method in order to record the efficacy of impregnating treat- ments on porous clay materials. The combination of these techniques could help scientists to have valuable information about mineral materials, in order to upgrade their properties.

During autogenous milling, the combination of shearing and compression forces, promotes selective attrition and delivers a better liberation. In order to investigate the effects of shear and compression on the cement recovery and specify the importance of them, a new set-up is designed and constructed. This set-up permits aforesaid forces to be determined and controlled. For experimental design, the MINITAB 16 software was used and 13 different experimental runs based on varying shear and compression forces were conducted. After each experiment, the amount of cement recovery using XRF analysis, water absorption of the recycled aggregates and energy consumption during the process were measured. Results show that both shear and compression forces have influence on improving the cement recovery. With simple changes in the setting of an autogenous mill like bed height or residence time the need for high-cost secondary crushing during concrete recycling could be eliminated. Keywords: concrete recycling, cement recovery, recycled aggregate I. Introduction Recycling End of Life (EOL) concrete is challeng- ing for the building sector because of the compet- ing constraints of low recycling process cost and high product quality. The C2CA process aims at a cost-effective system approach for recycling high- volume EOL concrete streams into prime-grade ag- gregates and cement. One of the main technologies considered within C2CA is autogenous milling. Af- ter crushing the EOL concrete, liberation of the cement paste is promoted by several minutes of grinding in an autogenous mill while producing as little as possible fine silica (Lotfi et al.,2014) and (Lotfi et al., 2013). The conventional EOL concrete recycling circuit is composed of simple size reduction and classi- fication for RA production. However, it does not deliver a high amount of liberated aggregate and cement paste(Kim et al., 2012). According to some studies ( Florea et al., 2013) the liberation of the cement paste in the fine fraction will enhance by increasing the number of crushing processes. A secondary crusher can apply pure compression and bring higher cement recovery. However, using pure compression is not always economic and beneficial. It requires a substantial amount of energy and there is a high possibility of breaking aggregate into the fine fraction. The idea of using autogenous milling instead of the secondary crushing has a root in a fundamental principle of mineral processing. In mineral process- ing, one of the aims of comminution is liberation of valuable components separated from gangue. In an autogenous mill, internally created shear and com- pression forces produce a gentle attrition among particles. Therefore, surface layers, edges or corners from crushed EOL concrete can be removed (King, 2012). In the present study, the influence of shear and compression forces on the cement recovery from EOL concrete was determined. Evidence is pre- sented that the amount of cement recovery in the crushed fine fraction EOL concrete is influenced by both shear and compression forces. The aim of this investigation is to enrich our understanding of the importance of noted forces with respect to the cement recovery and also enable advances in the field of concrete recycling. II.

Figure 1 shows the particle size distribution of the crushed parent concrete. Set-up for applying shear and compres- sion force A new experimental set-up with the purpose of applying controlled shear and compression on the bulk crushed concrete was designed and con- structed. The schematic of the Shear - Compression Machine (SCM) can be seen in Figure 2. The SCM consists of a vertical cylinder for the application the compression force. A ring-shaped container is placed under the vertical cylinder which is con- nected to an arm. An electrical engine connected to the arm is applied to move the container back and forth. The effective surface area of the container is 0.12 m 2 , and for each test it can be filled out with approximately 22 kg of crushed parent concrete. Experimental design In order to figure out the cumulative effects of two variables (shear and compression), it was decided to use Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Within RSM, Central Composite Design (CCD) is a popu- larly used method (Montgomery, 2008). As shown in Figure 3, a two-variable CCD is composed of 2 2 =4 factorial points, extended by 2 ⇥ 2 additional axial points and 5 centre points (t 0 ) (five replica- tions). In general, for a k-variable CCD, the total number of simulated runs T is calculated by: (1) Repeating runs at the centre of the design intro- duces a check on variability and repeatability into the data, providing a means to eliminate noise in the experimental results. The general form of RSM with the second-order model is expressed as: y = b 0 + Â b i x i + Â b ii x i 2 + Â b ij x i x j + e i 354 i i < j High level 36 KN 8 min Where b i represents the linear effect of x i , b ii represents the quadratic effect of x i , b ij represents the interaction between x i and x j and e is the fitting error. 2198 T = 2 k + 2k + t 0 Low level 1.2 KN 2 min (2) In this research, design and analysis of the central composite experiment were carried out using the MINITAB 16 software. The variable of compression was defined as the force exerted by the cylinder, whereas the variable of shear was represented by the duration of the back and forth motion of the arm. Both variables had two different levels (low and high, see Table 2). In line with Equation (1), the total number of simulated runs was 13 experiments. Analysis of the experimental samples After each experimental run, the particle size dis- tribution of crushed concrete was analysed. The chemical composition of CEMIII/B used in the par- ent concrete was determined using XRF (model PANalytical-Epsilon 3x spectrometers) (see Fig- ure 4). The XRF result of the cement shows the amount of SiO2 and CaO, 27.86 mass% and 47.55 mass% respectively (See table 3). In order to cal- culate the cement recovery, XRF analysis for all 0-1mm and 0-0.5mm fractions was conducted. Ac- cording to the primary weight of cement and silica (sand plus aggregate), and assuming that the main source of CaO in in the parent concrete was cement (compare Table 3 and 4), the total mass of CaO in the parent concrete could be calculated. XRF analysis of the 0-1mm and 0-0.5mm fractions yields the mass% of CaO. Thus using the mass (gr) of the considered fractions, their total mass(gr) of CaO can be calculated. The cement recovery is then cal- culated based on the calculated mass of CaO in the considered fraction divided by the total mass of CaO in parent concrete. The water absorption of the 4-16 mm fractions was determined to assess the amount of cement paste reduction and the energy consumption for each experimental run was calculated according to the torque measurement on the arm. Figure 5 shows the experimental set-up. A sensor was ap- plied to determine the amount of torque and energy consumption during the experiments. 15th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 1: Particle size distribution of parent concrete after primary crushing Table 3: XRF analysis of applied cement (CEMIII/B) in the parent concrete Component Mass% Component Mass% MgO 7,85% MnO 0,17% Al 2 O 3 10,33% Fe 2 O 3 1,32% SiO 2 27,86% CuO 0,01% SO 3 3,48% ZnO 0,02% K 2 O 0,47% SrO 0,10% CaO 47,55% Y 2 O 3 0,01% TiO 2 0,72% ZrO 2 0,03% V 2 O 5 0,01% SnO 2 0,02% Cr 2 O 3 0,00% BaO 0,04% Table 4: XRF analysis of applied aggregate in the parent concrete Component Mass% Component Mass% MgO 0,13% MnO 0,01% Al 2 O 3 2,79% Fe 2 O 3 0,17% SiO 2 94,83% CuO 0,01% SO 3 0,23% ZnO 0,01% K 2 O 1,30% SrO 0,00% CaO 0,21% Y 2 O 3 0,00% TiO 2 0,13% ZrO 2 0,02% V 2 O 5 0,01% SnO 2 0,13% Cr 2 O 3 0,01% BaO 0,00% 355 Lotfi & Rem III. Results and discussion Interpretation of the regression analysis Experiments were performed according to the ex- perimental plan and the results are given in Table 5 along with the results predicted by the model. Ta- bles 6 and 7 show estimated regression coefficients for cement recovery in the 0-1 mm and 0-0.5 mm fractions, respectively. Using T-test and P-values regression analysis was carried out. In general, the larger the magnitude of T and the smaller the value of P, the more significant is the coefficient term (Montgomery, 2008). Considering Tables 6 and 7, the effects of the linear factors on cement recovery are highly significant (P < 0.001). A positive sign of a coefficient represents a synergistic effect while a negative sign shows antagonistic effect. In both tables, it can be seen that the linear terms of com- pression force and shear duration, the quadratic term of force and the interaction term of force and duration have a positive effect on cement recovery. Those coefficients show that with an increase in the amount of force and duration the recovery per- centage of cement will increase. Considering the regression coefficients, two regression equations for cement recovery in two different fractions 0-1mm and 0-0.5 mm result as following: Y = 0.309341 + 0.079612X 1 + 0.039063X 2 + 0.014693X 1 2 0.008136X 2 2 + 0.014098X 1 .X 2 Y 0 = 0.201083 + 0.049825X 1 0 + 0.030094X 2 0 + 0.002352X 1 0 2 0.005516X 2 0 2 + 0.022357X 1 0 .X 2 0 (4) Where Y is the Recovery of cement into the 0- 1mm fraction and Y 0 is the recovery of cement into the 0- 0.5mm fraction.

In particular, S is close to the experimental error of the data. The high value of (R 2 = 97.06%, R 2 = 93.12%) and (R 2 (adj) = 94.96%, R 2 (adj) = 88.20%) show high correlation between the observed and predicted values of response. Main effect plot A main effect is present when different levels of factor influence the response differently. It is cre- ated by plotting the response mean for each factor level. A line is drawn to connect the points for each factor and a reference line is also drawn at the overall mean (Greenfield and Metcalfe, 2008). When the line is not horizontal, there is a main effect present. Different level of the factor affects the response differently. The greater the difference in the vertical position of the plotted points, the greater is the magnitude of the main effect. The main effect of the parameters Force and timing on cement recovery from 0-1mm and 0-0.5 mm fraction are given in Figure 6A and 6B. Reference line in figures 6A and 6B is 0.3114 and 0.2001 respectively. From the figures, it is observed that both timing and force have a positive effect on the cement re- covery. From the main effect plot, it is obvious that force has slightly more influence. Normal probability plot The normality of the data can be checked by plot- ting the normal probability plot of the residuals. The normal probability plot is a graphical tech- nique for assessing whether or not a data set is approximately normally distributed. Figures 7A and 7B show normal probability plot of residual values. Trends observed in those figures reveal well- behaved residuals. Based on this plot the residuals appear to be randomly scattered. Interpretation of surface and contour plots Contour and surface plots give a better understand- ing of the influence of variables and their interac- tion on the response. A contour plot provides a two-dimensional view, where all points having the same response are connected to produce contour lines. A surface plot provides a three- dimensional view that may provide a clearer picture of the re- sponse surface. Figure 8 shows the 3D or 2D plots relationship between two variables (force and tim- ing) and properties like cement recovery, water ab- sorption and energy consumption.

The duration of back and forth motion is indicated as timing duration, the weight of 0-1 mm fraction and the cement recovery are increased. Recovery of cement is affected by both compression and shearing and it is increased to more than 40% in 0-1mm fraction (see Figures 8A an 8B). Decreasing the amount of water absorption in coarse fraction 4-16mm, by in- creasing the amount of force and timing, is another evidence to prove the reduction of cement paste on the surface of recycled aggregates (see Figures 8C and 8D). The energy consumption raises by in- creasing the amount of timing and force . However, according to Figures 8E and 8F even by using the highest amount of force and timing, the energy con- sumption is less than 700 kJ/ton (0.19 KWh/ton). It shows that the cost of autogenous milling could stay in a reasonable range during concrete recycling process. IV. Conclusion In the C2CA concrete recycling process, autogenous milling of crushed end of life concrete is used to increase the liberation of the cement paste. This research is carried out to understand how shear and compression, and the combined effect of them inside of an autogenous mill, influence the cement recovery. In order to simulate forces in an autoge- nous mill in a controlled way, a new set-up was constructed. A central composite experimental de- sign with the help of the MINITAB 16 software for predicting the results of 13 experimental runs was used. According to the regression analysis, the effect of shear and compression on the cement re- covery for both 0-1 mm and 0-0.5 mm fractions was found to be strongly linear (P < 0.001). Comparing the main effect plots, force (compression) is slightly more effective than timing (shear). However, based on the achieved results, it is possible to replace the shear and compression with each other with the purpose of raising the cement recovery. There- fore, high amount of produced low-cost shear in an autogenous mill will eliminate the need for the expensive pure compression in a crusher. Variation in the strength of concrete could be compensated by simple changes in the mill feeding, the residence time and the bed height.

Several mix designs were tested, where both the binder type and aggregate composition were changed. The concrete was submersed in 1 wt-% sulphuric acid for 105 days and was examined both before and after submersion in the acid, using polarizing microscopy and SEM-EDX. Totally, nine different concretes were tested. The binders were respectively CEM I SR with fly ash, calcium aluminate cement, CEM III/B slag cement and geopolymer. The CEM I SR with fly ash binder was tested with different combinations of both siliceous and calcareous aggregate, while only siliceous aggregate was used for the other binders. The test showed various degree of deterioration of the concrete surfaces. Typically, the paste crumbled during the submersion in the acid leaving exposed aggregates. Depending on the rock type present and its porosity, the aggregate at the surface was intact, fractured or recrystallized into gypsum. Except for the concrete with geopolymer, all other binder types showed a similar change in the surface region, where the paste transformed into gypsum. Not only the paste transformed into gypsum, but gypsum was also seen in surface parallel cracks and in air voids. In cases where the aggregate (sand and stone) contained limestone (CaCO 3 ) this was also transformed into gypsum. The project showed that the most suitable mix design studied in order to withstand aggressive waste water appeared to be concrete containing CEM I SR cement with fly ash and a very fine sand consisting of porous limestone (the coarse aggregate was normal Danish siliceous material). In this sample, a rather straight, dense zone of gypsum was formed and almost no scaling of the surface occurred. It was further observed, the denser and more fragile the aggregate, the more scaling of the surface occurred. The deepest ingress of acid was in concrete with CEM I SR and fly ash, and concrete with slag cement, both with normal siliceous aggregate in both the fine and coarse fraction.

Introduction The chemically aggressive environment within con- crete sewer pipe structures exposes the inside sur- face of the structures to sulphuric acid attack. The cost of maintenance and repair of concrete sewer pipe is substantial. In Denmark alone the yearly costs of maintenance, repair and expansion is esti- mated to 1 billion DDK (Miljostyrelsen, 2006). The study described in this paper is part of a Danish research project aiming to develop concrete sewer pipe structures, which are more resistant to acid attack in order to achieve a prolonged service life of minimum 75 years. Different technologies are known to enhance the resistance of concrete to sulphuric acid attack, in- cluding limestone aggregate, calcium aluminate cement, slag cement and geopolymer binder (Al- lahverdi, 2000). Limestone aggregate will react with acid and thereby function as a sacrificial material, which neutralizes the acid so attack on the cement paste is reduced (Chang, 2005). Hydration of calcium alumi- nate cement results in a paste without Portlandite and the formation of alumina hydrate, which is sta- ble down to pH 3-4. Furthermore, the dissolution of other calcium aluminate hydrates during acid attack leads to formation of more alumina hydrate which infills pores (Scrivener, 1999). Slag cement is known to give a more dense paste microstruc- ture and thereby the ingress of acid during acid attack will be reduced (Bijen, 1996). Geopolymer is a binder composed of fly ash or slag activated by al- kaline solutions like sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate. This forms a polymeric network, which is known to be resistant to acid attack (Thokchom, 2009). 363 Jakobsen & Kaasgaard Table 1: Composition and test periods of the analysed samples.

II. Experimental A total of nine different earth moist concrete mix designs with different binder and aggregate types were tested (Table 1). The concretes were designed with equal water/cement ratio of 0.34 and equal volume content of paste (and aggregate). The spe- cific mix designs are presented in another article (Juel-Hansen, 2014). Cylindrical samples of diameter 100 mm and height 80 mm were prepared in a compactor, where the earth moist concrete was compacted between two angled eccentrically rotating piston heads, us- ing a compaction pressure of 4 bar. After 28 days of storage immersed in water at 20 C, the samples were exposed to a 1 wt-% sul- phuric acid solution (pH ⇠ 1) in order to investigate their sulphuric acid resistance based on a modified version of ASTM C267. At selected time steps up to 126 days of exposure, the samples were removed from the solution, rinsed under running water and weighed (in SSD state). Furthermore, the visual appearance was recorded and photo documented. At all the selected time steps, the 1 wt-% sulphuric acid solution was replaced by fresh solution. The re- sults from the weight measurements are presented in another article (Juel-Hansen, 2014). In this arti- cle, the results from microscopic evaluation of the samples after 105 days of exposure to the sulphuric acid solution are presented. The concrete was analysed using optical polar- izing microscopy, OPM, and scanning electron mi- croscopy, SEM-EDX. One fluorescent impregnated thin section and one polished section were pre- pared from each test cylinder. The sections were 364 soft positioned along and including one of the cylinder faces. The thin sections are made by vacuum impreg- nating a cut sample piece with an epoxy resin con- taining a fluorescent dye. Subsequently, the impreg- nated slices are mounted on objective glass and ground to a thickness of 0.020 mm (20 µm). Finally, the section is covered by a cover glass. The thin sections are then examined in a Leica DM2500P op- tical polarizing microscope using transmitted light, crossed polarized light, and fluorescent light. The filter combination used for fluorescent light is a LWP 530 yellow blocking filter and a BG 12 excita- tion filter (Jakobsen, 2000). The light source at the microscope is a 100W halogen bulb. The vacuum impregnation of the samples with epoxy causes all voids and cavities in the samples to be filled with fluorescent epoxy. By transmitting fluorescent light through the thin section in the microscope, the flu- orescent epoxy in the various porosities will emit yellow light that makes voids, cavities and cracks easy to identify. The fluorescent epoxy also impreg- nates the capillary pores in the hardened cement paste causing a dense cement paste with low water to cement ratio to appear darker green while a more porous cement paste with a high water to cement ratio appears lighter green. By this, the water to cement ratio (w/c) of the concrete can be estimated with an accuracy of ± 0.02. A detailed description of the sample preparation is found in (Jakobsen, 2000). The left over piece from the thin section produc- tion is again impregnated and then polished using first fixed diamond disks from Struers (MD Piano) with grid 500, 1200 and 2000 and then a Texmet Perforirt cloth from Buehlers with 6 µ m, 3 µm and 1 µm diamond spray. The polishing is performed using a Buehler Beta Polished with a Vector Power Head.

An accel- erating voltage of 20 kV, spot size 5 and a working distance of around 10 mm are used during analy- sis. The data are Proza corrected. The sample are carbon-coated and analysed in high vacuum mode. III. Results Microstructural appearance before acid exposure In order to check whether the concrete to be tested was properly cast, the microstructural appearance of 4 of the concretes were analysed before they were exposed to the acid (Table 1). The concretes all appeared relatively well-compacted with a ho- mogeneous, dense paste. Large irregular air voids are present. The cylinder sides appear relatively even with a thin pasta layer covering the aggregate. No larger cracks are present in the concrete. Mi- nor difference are however observed, differences with are related to the binder combination; e.g. the concrete with geopolymer has initially a distinct higher capillary porosity than concrete based on CEM I and calcium aluminate cement, and appears initially soft. Microstructural appearance after acid ex- posure After the 105 days exposure to acid, the con- cretes show different degree of deterioration (Figure 1). The concretes showing the most distinct scal- ing/abrasion are the reference concrete (RC), the concrete with calcium aluminate cement (CA), the CEM III /B concrete (SL), and the concrete with CEM I+FA and coarse limestone aggregate (KST). An intermedia scaling/abrasion is observed in con- crete with dense Norwegian limestone in both frac- tions (NOK), and in concrete with limestone in the coarse fraction and both limestone and Dan- ish siliceous material in the sand fraction (KGRSA). The concretes, which apparently have performed best, are the two concretes containing soft limestone in the sand fraction, (K) and (KSA).

The face of the cylinders in contact with the bot- tom of the acid container shows a distinct rusty-red staining (Figure 2). The degree of staining appears to correlate positively with the iron content of the cement; most intense staining is seen on the calcium aluminate concrete (CA) and least on the CEM III/B concrete (SL). Of the CEM I concretes, the reference (RC), without any limestone at all, show the most staining. All concretes, except the one with geopolymer (G), show distinct evidence of acid attack in the surface region (Table 2, Figures 3 and 4). From the surface and inwards, a 0.4 to 4 mm thick zone appears where the microstructure of the concrete is changed. This changed zone is generally more porous compared to the interior non-affected paste. In the concrete with geopolymer, the influence of the acid is only visible due to the presence of gyp- sum in air voids and chemically by EDX a weak Carbonation band, mm 0.8 0.6 not obs. 0 0.4 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.2 Gypsum in voids, mm 4-5 2 4 9 4-5 6 4-5 2.5 6 air increase of S can be traced. Based on the mineralogy and chemical compo- sition, the porous surface region can be divided into 3 or 4 zones, starting with an outer S-rich zone (Figure 3) containing gypsum, then a thin band rich in iron and or aluminium/silicon (Figure 4), and fi- nally a thin carbonated zone occurs before entering non-affected paste. Even though the paste behind the carbonated area appears non-affected by the acid, gypsum oc- curs in air voids to depths more than twice the depth of the distinctly affected surface region. Gypsum zone In the surface region, gypsum is typically replacing the cement paste and replacing limestone aggregate if present and is occasionally observed in surface parallel cracks and air voids. In concretes without limestone aggregate (RC, CA and SL), the paste and occasionally lime- containing porous flint aggregate converts into gyp- Figure 3: The surface of the concrete is enriched in S to different depth. The horizontal arrow indicates that the S- ingress of sample KST actually is much deeper as at least 2.5 mm of the surface has scaled. 366 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 4: In front of the S-enrichment, a narrow zone rich in Al occurs.

The cracks are mainly filled with gypsum but de-bond in the adhesion zone to the aggregate. Concrete with this texture appears to be the most porous and show the most severe crumbling and scaling at the surface. The concretes containing coarse limestone aggre- gate (NOK, KGRSA and KST) are in many ways similar to the concretes with Danish siliceous aggre- gate (RC, CA and SL), as cracks in these concretes also appear to penetrate the outermost positioned aggregate, even though they are limestone. The KST concrete containing coarse soft limestone but siliceous sand is the concrete showing the most severe scaling (Figure 6). In the concretes containing soft limestone sand (K and KSA), both paste and limestone sand is totally converted into gypsum forming a straight relatively dense zone, where typically only few cracks are observed, except in the front of the gypsum zone (Figure 7 and 8). In these concretes, debonding are not observed within the adhesion between aggre- gate and gypsum-filled cracks. Figure 9 shows examples from the X-ray mapping with distribution of S, Al and Ca. As seen, all aggregate as well as paste in surface of concrete KSA appears as one straight S-rich zone (turquoise) with few S-containing cracks at the interface to the more normal paste. The paste of the surface region of concrete KST is also rich in S, but the Figure 5: Typical deterioration pattern at the surface of concrete with siliceous material in both the coarse and fine aggregate fraction.

Sample KST. Exposed surface is towards the top of the image. In front of the gypsum zone, a distinct concentra- tion of iron and aluminum is observed (Figure 10). The iron band is typically less than 0.5 mm thick, the aluminum less than 0.3 mm, but the two "zones" are somewhat intermixed with each other. The iron band appears dense, with a Fe content above the background level of the various pastes. The highest content of about 5 at.% is found in the sample with calcium aluminate cement, CA. In the other samples, the Fe content is around 1 atomic% in this zone. In optical microscopy, and even macroscopically, the band can easily be seen by its distinct rusty red colour (Figure 10 & 11), similar to the colour observed on the bottom of the cylinders, when removed from the acid container (Figure 2). The aluminum/silicium-enriched band is diffi- cult to observe by OPM, but fluorescent light and SEM reveals a porous band rich in empty, very tiny small, random oriented cracks (Figure 12). The max- imum Al content of the zone varies depending on binder type from 3-6 at.% in samples with Portland and Slag cement to 18 at.% in the sample with cal- cium aluminate cement. This feature is illustrated in the bar-diagrams of Figure 13. Carbonation Just at the interface between the porous Al-band and "non-affected" paste, a thin band, less than 0.5 mm thick, of slightly carbonated paste appears. The band is easy recognized by OPM, but difficult to see using only SEM.

Exposed surface is towards the top of the image. highest S-concentration can be recognized in cracks. No conversion of the siliceous aggregate is seen in concrete KST. Chemically, the maximum content of S found in the zones are very alike at a maximum level between 12-16 at.%. The binder composition does therefore not seem to influence the max. S the sample can carry, but it distinctly influences the depth of S-ingress. This feature is illustrated in the bar-diagrams in Figure 13. 368 Figure 8: In concrete with soft limestone in the sand fraction but siliceous sand in the coarse fraction a similar dense gypsum zone is formed at the surface.

The paste in front of the interface looks un-affected by the acid, but do show evidence of the attack as gypsum crystals appear in air voids to depths of max. 9 mm. No distinct build-up of ettringite occurs at the exterior of the un-affected paste. IV. Figure 10: A distinct, wide, rusty red zone is seen in front of a dense gypsum zone in concrete KSA.

Discussion and Conclusion The petrographic study illuminates the different chemical changes and degradation of the concrete surfaces when exposed to a strong acid. As described, the concretes showing the deepest ingress of S, are the concretes with slag cement (SL), the reference concrete with Portland cement and fly ash (RC), and the concrete with Portland cement and fly ash, but with limestone in the coarse aggre- gate fraction instead of siliceous aggregate (KST). These three concrete mixes are also the concretes vi- sually showing the most distinct scaling and crum- bling of the cylinder surfaces. When looking at the data from the mass change study performed on the same samples (Juel-Hansen, 2014), the slag ce- ment concrete does, however, have a very low mass loss, especially much lower than the Reference (RC). Therefore, from a mass loss point of view, the slag cement concrete performs well, but from an acid ingress point of view, it performs the worst of the studied concretes. The reason for this conflicting data is not yet completely clear. In the microscope, the cause of the severe surface damages seems to be related to the formation of surface parallel cracks, infilling of gypsum, debond- ing, cracking of aggregates and decalcification of paste. Resultantly paste erodes, leaving exposed damaged aggregate at the surface. The concrete with the absolute less S-ingress is the one where the siliceous sand material is sub- stituted by limestone (KSA). This concrete is also 369 Jakobsen & Kaasgaard Figure 12: In all concrete independent on binder and aggregate type, a distinctly cracked zone is observed between the gypsum zone and the non-affected interior paste. This zone is enriched in Al and Si. Exposed surface is towards the top of the image.

The microanalysis show, that in this concrete, and in concrete with similar limestone ag- gregate, the paste (CSH) as well as the limestone is converted into gypsum, forming a relatively dense gypsum zone, where only minor abrasion occurs. Furthermore, only minor surface parallel cracking of paste and aggregate is observed. The mass con- version of the CSH binder as well as the limestone sand to gypsum seem to have a protecting effect instead of a damaging effect. So why do we see damage related to crack for- mation in some concretes and in others full paste conversion and less deterioration? According to Chang et. al, the exchange of normal aggregate with limestone aggregate neutralises the sulphuric acid, reducing the attack on the cement paste. Their theory is simply that the limestone is sacrificed dur- ing the attack. This study show, the finer and the more soft the limestone aggregate becomes the bet- ter the effect of neutralization. So why cracking? It appears that in the most scaled concrete aggregate do also crack. Actually, it is mainly the lime con- taining flint aggregate, which crack. It is speculated whether the acid entering these typically porous aggregate, react with calcium, forms gypsum that resultantly crack the aggregate and the surrounding paste. This may explain the severe scaling observed in concrete containing dense Ca-containing rock material in the aggregate fraction. The analysis further show that acid does enter the surface of all examined concretes; even the one with geopolymer, however, in this concrete the acid does not deteriorate the paste as the content of Ca present in the binder is too low for gypsum to form. The average S level of the surface region is however, constant in all concrete independent on binder and aggregate type. The average S/Ca level is around 1.2 at.%; probably indicating the maximum S ca- pacity of the concrete when concerting to gypsum (S/Ca of pure gypsum equals 1 at.%).

This was explained by Laugesen (1993) and has since proven its worth in understanding concrete microstructure, not least the water cement ratio in relation to (capillary) porosity. This paper recalls the findings of Laugesen (1993) presented at the 4 th Euroseminar in Visby, Gotland, and draws lines to a series of examples from real-life concrete. Furthermore, it is emphasized that general laboratory studies and research based on cement-based materials essentially needs to take this into account. Finally it is introduced, that the wall effect is also relevant for air void systems, trapping moisture at the rim and depleting the general cement paste for water. Microstructure details strongly supports this hypothesis, as well as experience from real life show that air entrained concrete have less tendency of bleeding.

Influence of sand & stones on the ‘effective water cement ratio’ of hardened concrete When adding more and more (SSD: Saturated Sur- face Dry) sand to a mix of cement paste, one ob- serves that it dries out and loses workability. This was explained by Laugesen (1993) and has since proven its worth in understanding concrete micro structure, not least the water cement ratio in rela- tion to (capillary) porosity. This paper recalls the findings of Laugesen (1993) presented at the 4 th Euroseminar in Visby, Gotland, and draws lines to a series of examples from real- life concrete. Furthermore, it is emphasized that general laboratory studies and research based on cement-based materials essentially needs to take this into account. As pointed out in (Laugesen, 1993) and (Scrivener et al., 2004) the packing of cement grains in a mor- tar or concrete is influenced by larger objects such as sand grains and coarse aggregates, a fact that can be described by the ‘wall effect’ (Figure 1). In short the normal packing and ‘interlocking’ of ce- ment grains in the paste are disturbed/reduced by a larger (sand) grain replacing an array of fresh cement paste. Along the boundary the increased space is filled by: Water! - being the only available easy-moving component. This, in turn, causes a de- pletion of the water content of the general cement paste. The more large grains (i.e. the more ‘large grain surface area’ the more the cement paste will be generally lowered in water content; hence the bulk cement paste will be denser, having a lower (capillary) porosity corresponding to a lower water- cement ratio. All in all this redistribution of water in the cement paste of concrete and the implica- tions to performance and analysis is the scope of this presentation. Figure 1: Illustration of the “wall” effect. A flat solid object placed at random in an assembly of cement grains would cut through grains. As this is impossible the pack- ing of grains is disrupted to give a zone of higher porosity and smaller grains in the zone close to the “aggregate”. From (Scrivener et al., 2004).

Microscope mag.: x200, PPL. expected as a result of the above, are rarely seen in the analysis of fluorescence impregnated thin sections. One exception is in case of coarse grained cement being used, re. Figure 2. This implies that the amount of moisture being trapped along the sand grain boundaries is related to the Blaine value of the cement: the coarser the cement the more moisture is trapped. The straight forward explanation of the apparent absence of a bright ‘halo’ may be that the trapped water does not constitute a uniform film, but is rather placed in the local small vacancies that would be taken by cement grains be it not for the sand grain. Furthermore, the relatively large thickness of thin sections of 20-30 microns may blur the appear- ance of an expected ‘halo’. Finally the precipitation of portlandite at the ITZ as detailed later, to some degree compensates the formation of ‘halos’. All in all the water trapped locally at the sand grain surface leads to larger local porosities here, and reduced (capillary) porosity in the bulk cement paste. This is easily seen in thin section in PPL due to denser packing of cement grains in bulk paste, re. Figure 3. Also in UVL the fluorescence thin sections will readily reveal the denser bulk cement paste due to reduced porosity, re. Figure 4. The implication of the actual microstructure, ce- ment packing and local water-cement ratio (capil- lary porosity) is sought quantified in the calcula- tions given in Table 1, 2 and 3. For a typical concrete mix design, as in the Exam- ples 1 and 2 (in Table 1, 2 and 3), the implication of the water binding is seen to be at least of the mag- nitude as the influence of aggregate absorption. Please keep in mind that water binding at the sand/aggregate surfaces is what actually happens in all concrete mixed! The implication to the cement paste, as studied in e.g. fluorescence impregnated thin sections, is that the bulk cement paste is already denser, and the ITZ (Inter Transition Zone) is more porous. This does influence the analysis we perform as detailed in the following. Due to the wall effect the bulk cement paste was , as calculated in Table 1, actually changed from a w-c ratio of simply calculated 0.45 to an actual 0.38! I repeat: This is what has actually already happened in all concrete samples that we analyze! Working with pure cement paste of 0.40 in w-c ratio, for e.g. research purposes, one will actually perform the experiments on a microstructure that corresponds to a w-c of (normally calculated) 0.47 in concrete, as seen in the example in Table 2; with other sands and mix designs these values change. This implies that ANY research results obtained from cement paste of w-c ratio 0.40 CANNOT be directly related to a concrete of (normally calcu- lated) w-c ratio of 0.40. It must be emphasized that the applied ‘thick- ness’ of the water binding of 0.005mm has not been thoroughly documented for a range of concrete mix designs. However, a series of carried out experi- ments indicate that the magnitude may not be all too wrong. II. Relations with influence on the ’effective w-c ratio’ Normal concrete mix designs actually have rela- tively small variations in sand content; furthermore, the fineness of the sand ( ⇠ the ‘water demand) is compensated by adjusting the sand content. This implies that the actual variations in ‘effective water- cement ratio’ are not as large as may first be antic- ipated; which is great for the field of thin section fluorescence analysis... Another issue is the location of the portlandite 375 Laugesen Figure 4: Same cement paste with additions of little, some and much sand, respectively. Microscope mag.: x63, UVL. being formed – due to the larger available spaces at the sand grains and stones, the porous ITZ is somewhat densified by the precipitation of port- landite. Some literature erroneously describes this as a ‘rim-of-portlandite’ being formed round the aggregate grains. III. Influence of air void structure on effective water-cement ratio Playing with air bubbles you will find that when- ever a bubble bursts it leaves a wet mark on your hand, shirt or on the ground – wherever it bursts. Air voids in fresh concrete acts as a particle, hence to move an air void it needs to ‘push away’ the cement paste, sands or stone in front of it. This ‘particle’ would have similar implications to trap- ping water as seen in the following. With the analogy of the sand grains in the cement paste, it is hereby claimed that the formation of air voids likewise traps moisture around the periphery of the air void. This in turn further depletes the bulk cement paste for moisture. The microstructural features described for the general wall effect seems also to be relevant for the ’air void ITZ’; hence larger cement grains are not located right at the rim, and portlandite crystals may well be concentrated locally at the rim; re. Figure 5. It is a well-known fact from real life, that bleeding of a mix design of concrete can be remedied by adding an air void system to the concrete. With the above we may now understand why. The influence on w-c ratio of the cement paste has not been assessed by experiments, but from the small calculation below, it appears to be on a smaller scale that the sand, as may be expected. Figure 5: Cluster of air voids in concrete; note that the rim of each air void is very complete and smooth, that the larger cement grains are placed away from the rim (same as typically seen at the ITZ), and that some portlandite is precipitated along the rim (right-hand photo).

The examples presented in Table 4 and 5 show that by entering an air void system of 5% air with a specific surface of 30 mm 1 , the effective w-c ratio of the cement paste is lowered from 0.45 to 0.43. HOWEVER: It must be noted that the here ap- plied ‘thickness’ of the water binding at the air voids of 0.005 mm has not yet been experimentally documented! IV. Concluding remarks What we analyze at fluorescence microscopy of the cement paste in concrete thin sections, using UVL, is (capillary) porosity – this is an enormously strong tool, unsurpassed by others in the allowed detail, quantification and ease of analysis. Any correlation with this porosity to composition and w-c ratio needs to be based on reference samples. It should be emphasized that we have ALWAYS used the bulk (capillary) porosity of the cement paste, i.e. the ‘effective’ w-c ratio in our thin section analysis, as demonstrated in the present paper. 380 171 0.45 5.0 7.9 0.43 Looking at old concrete to evaluate the durability and present condition, the actual chloride ingress boundary and the carbonation fronts in general, surely appear to be a uniform ingress front without apparent curving neither along the coarse aggre- gates nor the sand grains. (One very large exception from this is naturally the many concrete structures where the concrete was bleeding, or the microstruc- ture is inhomogeneous, due to otherwise poor mix design, inadequate mixing, and/or poor workman- ship, such as e.g. over vibration.) Hence, the capillary porosity of the bulk cement paste is one of the main controlling parameters in concrete durability. This feature is easily, fast and accurately assessed by fluorescence thin section microscopy, a tool that should be implemented in concrete research to a much higher degree than at present.

This study presents the results that tend to explain the degradation mechanisms of five different mortars, including regular OPC and OPC-additions systems (slag and limestone filler) immerged in sulfate solutions (16g/L). In particular, we try to explain through quantitative measurements the benefic role of certain mineral additions. We have thus associated conventional characterization technics (such as SEM, EDX and expansion measurements) to quantitative mineralogical maps (so called ‘mineralogical gradients’) obtained by image analysis using recent supervised classification development. In this study we formalized through these quantitative mineralogical maps obtained by image analysis that microstructural changes which occur when sulfate ions penetrate into mortars are visible in zones, as mentioned by several past studies. These maps allowed us to convert images in mineralogical profiles in which portlandite, monosulfoaluminate (MSA), gypsum, porosity and additions are precisely quantified in function of depth and time. We have especially focused our interest on the quantity of MSA pockets and tried to relate their distribution on their ability to resist on sulfate attack. Keywords: sulfate attack, multispectral imaging, SEM-EDX, mortars, expansion I. Introduction Sulfate ions from groundwater and soils may in- duce concrete deterioration. This type of degra- dation is generally attributed to the precipitation of ettringite from the aluminum-bearing phases of the hydrated cement paste (mainly calcium mono- sulfoaluminate) and sulfate ions from the concrete environment, leading to internal stresses and expan- sion. Recent research (Yu, 2013) has shown that the initial stage of expansion could be more specifically related to the formation of microcrystals of ettrin- gite from calcium monosulfoaluminate confined within C-S-H. On the opposite, monosulfoalumi- nate in the so called ‘capillary porosity’ (pockets) would convert to ettringite in presence of sulfate without causing stress in the material, thus playing the role of ‘buffer’ by consuming sulfate without causing any harm. The development of a new image analysis tech- nique using supervised classification allowed us to better quantify the role of the ’buffer’ monosulfoa- luminate. Indeed, with this technique it becomes possible to classify objects of similar chemical com- position of a few µm 2 , on a representative area (sev- eral mm 2 ), in a reasonable time. The ’mineralogical maps’ obtained allow to quantify for the first time the distribution (in space and size) of these ’pock- ets’. Combining these ‘maps’ to more conventional techniques (expansion of mortar prisms, SEM / EDS spot analyses) helps to confirm the origin of these ’pockets’, their fate under sulfate attack and their role in expansion. Besides, OPC-limestone mixes are generally con- sidered to demonstrate poor durability in sul- fate environments. At low temperature (typically 5 C), thaumasite precipitation (and C-S-H dissolu- tion) can be the reason for this poor performance (Barcelo, 2014). However it is not the case at higher temperature, in which case poor performance of OPC-limestone blends That has been attributed to a ‘dilution effect’ (in case OPC is simply replaced by limestone), leading on one hand to a higher poros- ity and higher diffusivity of the hydrated cement paste thereby increasing the ingress of sulfate ions (Dhir, 2004) and the other hand to lower mechanical properties. Only a few studies have investigated the possible mineralogical and microstructural reasons for this poor performance (Schmidt, 2008). As for pure OPC, Mineralogical maps combined with spot analyses reveal that in presence of limestone filler there are no pocket of monocarboaluminate formed that could lead to a more important formation of microcrystals of ettringite and to earlier expansion. The application of the new image analysis tech- nique described here give insights on the potential 379 Meulenyzer et al. Table 1: Chemical composition of materials.

This study investigates mineralogical evolutions in deterioration of three mortars based on a CEM I, a mixture of CEM I with 30wt% slag and CEM I with 30 wt% limestone filler immersed for two years in a sodium sulfate solution. Material and mixture characteristics The CEM I cement was commercial cement con- taining a medium amount of C 3 A. The main oxide contents, the main phase contents and other char- acteristics of these materials feature in Tables 1 and 2. The volumes of the cement or combination, sand (AFNOR sand) and water were kept constant for all mortars (EN mortar) with a cement or combination content of 510 kg/m 3 and w/cm ratio of 0.50. The test solution contains sodium sulfate, 16 g/l SO 4 (23.66 g/l or 0.17 mol/l sodium sulphate). The test solution was prepared with tap water. The solu- tion volume to mortar volume ratio was fixed at 5.2. This solution was renewed after every measurement (8 times over 2 years). II. Experimental procedure Length changes For every mortar 6 bars (20 ⇥ 20 ⇥ 160 mm) were casted. The all specimens were first cured for 28 days in tap water in capped plastic boxes. The water volume to mortar volume ratio was fixed at 5.2. At the end of the curing time, 3 bars were placed into the sodium sulphate solution while the 3 others stayed in water. Water was never changed. Length changes of all the specimens were measured after 28, 56, 84, 144, 196, 231, 252, 310 and 365 days of exposure and the level of visual degradations was quantified thanks to a "visual degradation index". Supervised classification image analysis As it is detailed in (Meulenyzer, 2013), the ensemble of a BSE-SEM image and its corresponding SEM- EDS elemental maps forms a cube dataset, in which each pixel represents a vector of B elements, or, more generally, B bands. For SEM-EDS, we are concerned with 10 or more major elements, thus making the image a large multispectral image. Due to the high dimensionality of a multispectral image, we have use an advanced image classifi- cation algorithm that has shown excellent perfor- mance on classifying such images. This ’spectral- spatial’ algorithm consists on exploiting both the spectral information in each pixel, as well as the spectral information of the neighboring pixels. The spectral classification algorithm is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. In the SVM approach, 2 main inputs are needed: i) a multispectral image (e.g. the SEM-BSE image + SEM-EDS maps), and ii) ’training’ or ’learning points. The training points are user-defined areas in the multispectral image, which define the spec- tral ’signature’ of each of the classes in the image. The signatures of each phase are then used by the SVM algorithm to efficiently divide the spectral space into regions by maximizing the margin be- tween classes. When the multispectral image of interest is analyzed, each pixel, with its correspond- ing spectra, is mapped and then assigned to a class. The probability for a pixel belonging to that class is also calculated. The SVM algorithm is a ’pixel wise classifier’, since it classifies each pixel using only the spectral information at each pixel, without regard to the properties of the neighboring pixels. This approach has limitations in real images, where neighboring pixels are generally coupled, or related. This coupling is especially true for SEM-EDS maps, where the X-ray signal is generated from Table 2: Phase content (Rietveld analysis) and fineness.

To overcome this coupling effect, the SVM classification map is ’regularized’, or refined. Here, we use a Markov Random Field (MRF) regulariza- tion strategy. The MRF algorithm is based on the assumption that it is generally likely to have neigh- boring pixels belonging to the same class. To do this, the MRF algorithm compares the class prob- abilities (calculated by the SVM) of the pixel of interest and of each neighboring pixel, and assigns the most likely class (with highest probability) for the pixel of interest. Sample preparation and EDS measurements Each sample was prepared using a classical Log- itech Pack 301 r epoxy resin is used and the two constituents of resin are mixed with 4 volumes of resin for 1 volume of hardener during around 1 minute. Before impregnated the powder or the paste, the epoxy was curing-vacuum during 5 min- utes in order to remove enclosed air. Grinding steps have been automatically done with slight down- ward pressure applied using progressively finer SiC powders and Buthandiol alcohol solution on a slotted steel plate. An optical microscope is used to control the final quality of surface. Then sam- ples have been polished using successively finer diamond paste in the following succession: 1 µm and 0.25 µm during several hours. After the sam- ple was cleaned, the specimen is then coated with carbon to provide a conductive surface for SEM microanalysis. The microstructural changes were studied with backscattered electrons and X-Ray maps in the SEM (FEI Quanta 400 ESEM FEG with an acceleration voltage of 15 keV). The changes of the elemental composition were followed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS measurements were corrected with the ZAF correction. Oxide con- tents were calculated from the measured elements. III. Results and discussion Expansion on mortars Expansion of CEM I and CEM I + 30% slag mortar bars were very similar over a year. Expansion of the CEM I + 30% limestone filler mortar started earlier and was nearly three times higher after one year of immersion. Divergence of slopes of the CEM I and the CEM I + limestone was significant after 150 days. Quantitative sulfate concentration in function of depth In order to determine the minimal depth in which the gradients are representative (ie until the varia- tions of phases is no more measurable), we have per- formed SO 3 (atomic %) quantification using SEM- EDS as described before. SO 3 profiles are repre- sented in Figure 2. We illustrate through this Figure the methodol- ogy used to measure SO 3 concentration from the surface to core of sample. We have decided to choose areas (at magnification ⇥ 2000) in the paste, included all phases without taking in account sand aggregates. This allowed us to have a ’global’ con- tent of SO 3 in the paste, and only in the C-S-H. As shown in Figure 2, SO 3 concentration is stable after 3 mm from the surface. We have in consequence chosen 3.5 mm as the maximal depth analyzed in the next sections. It will correspond to 9 field of view at the magnification ⇥ 350 (with an image size of 1024 ⇥ 884 pixels). 381 Meulenyzer et al. Figure 2: SO 3 concentration measured by SEM-EDS in function of depth for the studied systems. General overviews of microstructures are given in the legend. In order to determine a map of gradients profile for each mineral phase, we have performed image analysis as described in section 2.2.4 on individual multispectral set (ie BSE + elementary mapping of Al, Si, Ca, S, Na Mg, K, Fe, Mn, Ti). Each view in Figures 4 and 5 is composed by a mosaic of 9 ⇥ 8 individual images. Each image (1024 ⇥ 884) was taken at ⇥ 350 magnification. As a reference before sulfate ingress (and deterioration), we show also a 28 day image for each mortar, excepted for OPC- Slag sample which is in progress at the time this paper was written. Colors for phases in Figure 4 Gradients measurements and representativeness All the samples have been observed considering that’s important to be representative enough in our conclusions. We have focused our representative- ness study on the OPC mortar in order to make in evidence what could be the number of fields of views required to be stable in phase measurements. Thus we have observed the cumulative fraction of paste (paste is chosen as a pertinent indicator) in function of the number of images classified. Of course the higher number of images we integrate in Figure 3: Cumulative fraction of paste in OPC mortar in function of the number of images taken in account in height. 382 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 4: Backscattered electron images of OPC, OPC-LF (Limstone Filler) and OPC-Slag at 28 (before immersion), 250 (T1), 350 (T2) and 720 (T3) days.

Each image is a composition of a mosaic composed by 9 ⇥ 8 individual images with a pixel size of 0.350µm /pixel (visible as an artifact of reconstruction in the latest on). cumulative fraction, the higher representative value we have. In Figure 3, we are trying to determine what could be precisely the optimal size (height and depth) of the global field of view for a selected system in order to get a representative gradient of mineralogical phases.

The measures have been performed with 3 different zones of 9 ⇥ 8 images. The cumulative fraction of paste includes the porosity (macro / capillary porosity that could be observed in BSE images). That’s the reason why the first µm from surface haven’t been shown here is due to leaching that increase highly this value and also the resin beyond the surface. As shown in consequence in Figure 3 the cumulative percentage of paste starts to stabilize with 20 images in a given height (column that represents a depth from sur- face). We have decided to take in account 3 zones of 9 ⇥ 8 images to get a representative gradient. Meulenyzer et al. Evolution of the microstructure upon sulfate ingress In this section we focus our analysis of microstruc- ture on local scale from core to surface of OPC and OPC-LF mortars (at T2 = 360 days). We have been especially interested by the evolution of zones com- bining a high concentration of sulfates (S in SO 3 through Sulfur X-Ray maps) and alumina (Al in Al 2 O 3 through Al x-ray maps). During the learning step, which consists of assigning a color to a phase, we have identified using EDS spectroscopy phases like monosulfoaluminate, trisulfoaluminate and monocarboaluminate (OPC limestone filler mortar) structures in zones containing high concentration of sulfates. Two of these three phases appeared in the form of ’pockets’ and they have been then classified in all images. We describe in Figure 7 and Figure 8 what could 3.3.1 Microstructural évolution of OPC-T2 mortar Figure 7: Microstructural phase evolution of OPC-T2 mortar at local scale from surface (left) to core of mortar (OPC).

Gradients measurements We have calculated the gradient of a given phase taking in account representativeness study de- scribed before. Each ‘depth’ is represented by 24 images. Each point of the curves below is a mean value of a window with a size equivalent to total height of the 24 images. The larger of this window is half a single image (512 pixels) and is moving by step of 35 µm. Figure 6 shows the evolution of phase fraction (MSA, MCA, TSA, gypsum) for the 3 studied sys- tems at T2 in function of depth. It is interesting in the case of OPC to note that the MSA grains are in- creasing with depth whereas the TSA is decreasing. In the case of OPC-LF, we have observed a ‘dense’ zone containing TSA grains in the middle of sam- ple whereas the quantity of MCA grains slowly decreasing from core to surface. The case of slag must be study in more details since the difference between MSA and TSA was more difficult to obtain. We only observe at this moment a front of gypsum grains near 1 mm from the surface. IV. Conclusion and perspectives We have presented a methodology based on recent developments in image analysis that allowed us to study phase evolutions in mortars immerged in sulfate solutions. Our present paper was focused on OPC, OPC-LF and OPC-Slag (T2) and allowed us: • To evaluate qualitatively the evolution of mi- crostructure at local scale • To measure gradients of selected mineralogical phases in function of depth. We have especially observed that fraction of pock- ets of MSA or MCA evolved from surface to core of each sample. More investigations are needed to attribute a pre- cise role of these pockets. Especially we will drive our efforts on others T1 and T3 and compare all the gradients measured. Also EDS spectroscopy on these pockets must be performed EDS in order to understand more the origin of expansion.

Initially a 2-3 cm thick layer of steel fiber reinforced sprayed concrete with extruded perlite aggregate was employed for fire protection of polyethylene (PE-) foam panels used for water and frost protection. Repair work in 2002 involved spraying of some new perlite concrete and a ca 40 mm thick outer layer of fire resistant sprayed concrete with micro-polypropylene (micro-PP) fiber. Petrography, SEM and XRD in 2011 showed that the spalling zone, being located around the interface between the two concrete layers, contained mainly thenardite. Also the adjacent micro-PP fiber concrete was partly influenced. Mirabilite was not detected, whilst minor amounts of a thaumasite-like phase was occasionally present. The entire layer of perlite concrete was very friable and had suffered destructive steel fiber corrosion. This was characterised by extensive carbonation, internal sulfurised Popcorn calcite deposition (PCD) and severe Ca-depletion of the cement paste matrix, hence resembling some features of acid attack. Spalling was particularly well developed where water had seeped through the PE-foam plates and affected by freeze/thaw. The tunnel is located within a Permian rhomb-porphyry lava sequence with no external sulfate source, and the concrete sand aggregate was devoid of sulfur-bearing minerals. However, stable S isotopic signatures (d 34 S) imply that perlite aggregate contributed sulfuric acid: The S isotopes in thenardite, sulfurised carbonate and acid leached residue were lighter than common cement gypsum sources. Variable moisture and temperature conditions, frost action and dynamic loads from the traffic provided a favourable environment for micro cracking, ion migration, precipitation /dissolution and combined action of thenardite and pore-ice.

Introduction Sprayed concrete is used in Norwegian road tun- nels for rock mass reinforcement in conjunction with rock bolts and as fire protection of polyethy- lene (PE) foam panels used for water and frost protection. Degradation of tunnel concrete is not a general problem. However, steel reinforced sprayed concrete for rock support has suffered some slow degradation in the Alum shale environment, due to Thaumasite Sulfate Attack (TSA) with associated popcorn calcite depositiom (Hagelia et al. 2001, 2003). Also a spotwise significant sprayed concrete deterioration caused by combined bacterial and abi- otic attack occurs in some subsea tunnels, leading to localised thinning where Mn and Fe-rich biofilms are acting simultaneously with Ca-leaching, pop- corn calcite deposition, TSA and Mg attack (Hagelia 2007, 2013). In general thicker layers of sprayed con- crete are more durable than relatively thin layers (Davik 1998, Hagelia 2011). In contrast, degrada- tion of sprayed concrete used for fire protection is apparently uncommon, although mechanically induced fracturing has been observed in some tun- nels (Norwegian Public Roads Adminsitration 1997, Davik 1998). This paper reports on a severe attack within sprayed concrete used for fire protection of PE- foam panels in a road tunnel in East Norway. This unusual incident, involving sprayed concrete with light weight perlite-aggregate, had caused severe spalling and closure of the tunnel for nearly three years. 387 Hagelia History of concrete degradation in the Nes road tunnel and main technical data The Nes road tunnel on expressway E16 in East Norway was opened for traffic in 1988. The tunnel is 1276 m long, serving about 11000 vehicles every day. Steel fiber reinforced concrete and rock bolts were used for rock mass reinforcement, whilst PE- foam panels were installed as an inner lining for water and frost protection. Due to the inflammable properties the PE- panels were fire-protected by a 2-3 cm thick layer of steel fiber reinforced light- weight sprayed concrete, containing very porous extruded perlite and sand aggregates. After about ten years in service some damage was discovered within the perlite sprayed concrete at several places. A detailed inspection was undertaken in 2002, un- raveling need for reparations. Loose rock mass amounting to about 500 kg was also discovered at one location behind the water panel. The dam- age in perlite sprayed concrete was characterised by horizontal and vertical penetrative cracks, sev- eral of which carried water leakages. Reparations in 2002 involved sealing of wide cracks with PE- foam, whilst smaller cracks with water leakages were sealed with silicon. Thereafter the cracks were sprayed by new steel fiber reinforced perlite con- crete. A special adhesive was applied for making the concrete stick to the PE-panels. In order to fur- ther strengthen the light-weight sprayed concrete a ca. 4 cm thick layer of concrete with micro-PP fiber was sprayed in the lower parts of the tun- nel profile along the entire tunnel length, reaching about one meter above the road level. The micro-PP fibers concrete was subsequently covered by a ca. 3 cm thick spray of fiber-free “ordinary” sprayed concrete (Figure 1%2). In the early morning on March 3 rd , 2011 about 200 kg of sprayed concrete fell down, and one ve- hicle was damaged. The tunnel was immediately closed for traffic, at first for a thorough inspection. The conclusion after inspection was that the tun- nel should be closed on permanent basis and that complete refurbishment would be the most feasible solution. The tunnel was not reopened for traffic until February 2014. The 1988 sprayed perlite concrete (Robotic 10) was made with Portland cement, silica fume and steel fiber reinforcement. The cement was most likely CEM I. Water glass was used as setting accel- erator. However, the water/binder ratio and other details have not been reported. In 2002 thorough water cleaning of the entire tunnel was undertaken prior to reparation. The new concrete mixes are pre- sented in Table 1. According to internal documents at NPRA the work was thoroughly controlled dur- ing and after it was finished, showing good and satisfactory workmanship. 388 Inspections in 2011 by NPRA and Norconsult showed that spalling of the perlite concrete was developed throughout most of the tunnel. It was not possible to differentiate visually between dam- aged and undamaged areas, because hammering unraveled a much wider extent of spalling than was obvious through superficial inspection. Observa- tions clearly indicated that the spalling involved frost action and carbonation, likely assisted by vi- brations due to dynamic air pressure induced by vehicles (Holm 2011). However, no laboratory anal- ysis and microscopy were applied. Objectives Due to the severe implications of the concrete degra- dation it was decided to undertake a more detailed investigation, with the clear aim of diagnosing the deterioration mechanism and its causes. The objec- tives of this work were to: • Present the main tunnel observations and sam- pling of degraded sprayed concrete • Characterise and diagnose the degradation mechanisms by the aid of concrete petrography, X-ray diffraction and Scanning electron microscop (SEM) analysis • Investigate the ultimate source of aggressives involved, assisted by stable S isotope analysis • Discuss the spalling mechanism II. Methods in the field and laboratory Field methods Samples were collected in April 2011 after the tun- nel was closed. Spalls and smaller samples of de- graded concrete were collected from different layers along with degradation products located at the in- terface between perlite concrete and outer micro PP-fiber concrete. Spall samples were collected in plastic bags and sealed and debris samples were put into small glassed with tight plastic lids. All samples were essentially dry. Laboratory methods The analytical work is summarised in Table 2. The thin sections were investigated under a standard polarising microscope and analysed by SEM. Debris samples and chips of friable concrete were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Stable S-isotopes were analysed in two samples. Preparation of thin sections. Two concrete spalls, approximately two cm thick, were cut at right angle across layering with a diamond saw and washed thoroughly. Standard polished thin sections with- out fluorescent dye were prepared on 27 mm x 45 totally disintegrated concrete. The PE-foam panels were exposed at several locations (Figure 1).

Nes-1 consisted of thenardite and a little quartz. Nes-4 contained quartz, calcite and lesser amounts of thernardite, with a possible very minor amount of vaterite. Nes pr. 2 was particularly interesting in that two forms of sodium sulfate occurred. Thenardite, be- ing face-centered orthorhombic Na 2 SO 4 (form V) and base-centered orthorhombic sodium sulfate (form III) occurred together with quartz and a lit- tle calcite. Portlandite and gypsum were possibly present. Mirabilite (Na 2 SO 4 · 10H 2 O) was not de- tected. Sample Nes-2 of white and very strongly de- graded perlite concrete contained much thenardite and also Ca-mordenite (CaAl 2 Si 10 O 24 · 7H 2 O), which is a zeolite. XRD analysis of Nes-2 also indi- cated presence of a silicon oxide (Si 100 O 200 ). This substance is known mainly as a molecular sieve. Its occurrence in degraded perlite concrete remains obscure, but it seems possible that this silicon oxide may be related extruded perlite or silica fume. Sample Nes pr 1 of white efflorescence sitting on the rhomb porphyry rock mass behind the PE-foam panel (Figure 1) contained thermonatrite (Na 2 CO 3 (H 2 O)) with lesser amounts of quartz and anorthite. There was no evidence of sulfur bearing phases. Hence, it seems very unlikely that ground water in the area is enriched in sulfate. Sample Nes pr 3 of white efflorescence precipitated on a penetrative crack in one of the tunnel portals (cast Polarising microscopy XRD X X SEM X X X S- isotopes X X X X X X X X X X concrete) consisted mainly of pure calcite, yet with possible traces of portlandite and gypsum. This likely represents leaching of the concrete. Petrography - polarising microscopy Thin section N1 of extensively carbonated sprayed perlite concrete was characterised by a light brown- yellowish cement paste matrix when viewed in plane polarised light. The paste was extensively leached, with isotropic character in crossed po- lars. The carbonation was represented by ubiq- uitous Popcorn calcite deposition (PCD) with in- dividual calcite grains typically about 20-50 µm. However, also much finer carbonation had occurred, resembling features of ordinary carbonation. Cal- cite was also deposited in some air voids and lo- cally within the pore space of perlite. Portlandite was apparently absent. Only few suspect grains of unhydrated cement were observed within the Ca- depleted cement paste matrix. Some undispersed brown silica fume globules, about 50-150 µm big, were found scattered about in the matrix. Also, dark brown, transparent and glass-like spheres about 20-50 µm big were found, probably repre- senting fly ash agglomerations. Rusty iron-rich deposits occurred, which had also led to a brown staining of the adjacent cement paste matrix. No steel fiber were preserved in the thin section, however, holes in the middle of some dense rust deposits suggested that less corroded steel had Table 3: Summary of XRD results on degraded concrete from the Nes road tunnel.

The perlite aggregate particles were ranging in sizes from about 50 to 1000 µm and were extremely porous. Suspect thin glass shards of perlite were also observed scattered about in the cement paste matrix, which was confirmed in SEM. The remain- ing aggregate consisted of granitic rocks including micro-granite, siltstone and single grains of plagio- clase, quartz, biotite and amphibole. The aggregate particles were rounded to angular with D max about 5 mm. Opaque minerals were mainly Fe-Ti-oxides. Inspection in reflected light, using an external light source, showed that sulfide minerals were absent. Thin section N2 included both sprayed perlite concrete and outer micro-PP fiber sprayed concrete. The perlite concrete here was sharing the same characteristics as sample N1. In contrast, the ce- ment paste matrix in the outer sprayed concrete with micro-PP fiber was dark brown in plane polar- ized light, and did not appear to be much leached. The contact region adjacent to perlite concrete was, however, somewhat porous, with some large entrap- ment voids (reaching 300 µm). In a small domain next to an entrapment void apparent thaumasite had replaced cement paste, showing typical straw yellow color in plane polarised light and grey first order birefringence in cross polarised light. How- ever, the SEM work showed this to be a little more complex. The aggregate in outer concrete consisted of granitic rocks, siltstone, limestone, mica-gneiss, quartzite, and single grains of quartz, feldspars, am- phibole and biotite. The aggregate particles were otherwise similar in shape and grading as in the sprayed perlite concrete. In a single micro-domain a gel-like isotropic material was found forming a thin rim inside an air void. Scanning electron microscopy, micro-analysis and X-ray mapping The SEM analysis was performed on the thin sec- tions and several small debris samples. Analytical data from these two sample types must be regarded as complimentary. Sodium sulfate is soluble and not expected to have been preserved during thin sections preparation, which involved water cool- ing. Moreover, additional SEM work on samples analysed by XRD might shed further light on their composition, because of the possibility of mixed or amorphous phases. Perlite concrete in thin sections N1 and N2. Fig- ure 3 shows a typical micro domain of perlite con- crete in sample N2. The image is from outer perlite concrete few mm beneath the micro-PP fiber con- crete and may represent the 2002 spray. Severe carbonation here had caused destructive steel fiber corrosion. The mineral aggregate was quartz-rich 392 with no sign of sulfides. The cement paste matrix was characterised by extensively developed PCD and finer grained carbonates. The initial calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) was completely degraded due to Ca-leaching, and the matrix was very friable and porous with variably penetrative micro-cracks. Undispersed silica fume lumps (100-200 µm) and suspect fly ash spheres (20-50 µm) were observed. The results of X-ray element mapping are shown in Figure 4. The element distribution shows that Ca, O and lower intensities of C occupy the same domains in the paste. This reflects the presence of calcium carbonate, which was also Mg-substituted especially in the upper right parts of the analysed frame. However, the highest intensities of carbon represent epoxy in highly porous perlite, air voids and micro-cracks. The iron stained paste is clearly indicated by high Fe intensity. It is noteworthy that S was mainly occurring in the cement paste matrix, whilst the lower intensities of Na and Cl were scattered about without any particular relation to phase boundaries observed in back scatter. Most likely the latter feature reflects presence of soluble de-icing salt being smeared out on the thin section surface as a result of preparation. The mineral aggregate particles were clearly indicated by the higher intensities of Si, Al, K, Na and Ti. Perlite was not well indicated on this map, being overshadowed by other phases. An important observation was that a very signif- icant amount of the pore space of extruded perlite had in fact collapsed. Strings and shards of perlite glass occurred scattered about everywhere, being well embedded within depleted cement paste ma- trix with PCD (Figure 5). These textural relations clearly suggest that collapse must be a primary feature, e.g. that partial perlite collapse has taken place already during the spraying operation. Micro-PP fiber concrete in thin section N2. SEM imaging confirmed that this outer concrete was sounder than the perlite concrete. The cement paste was often characterised by a normal look- ing cement paste matrix without PCD and other obvious signs of extensive moisture transport and Ca-depletion. However, the surface region was very porous and inhomogeneous, with occasional big lumps of undispersed silica fume, as seen in Fig- ure 6C. The thaumasite like material (Figure 6B), located in a small micro domain about 200 µm away from perlite concrete, had replaced local ce- ment paste, hence resembling features of a localised Thaumasite sulfate attack (TSA). However, chemical analysis showed that this is not a typical thaum- asite but rather a very carbonate rich thaumasite- ettringite like phase (see details below). This min- eral occurred in presence of a large entrapment void, and had also formed a faint fringe deposit inside this void. The entrapment void was joined 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 3: Back scatter image of severely carbonated perlite concrete (thin section N2) with Fe-rich corrosion product (bright) having stained adjacent carbonated cement paste matrix. Aggregate particles were mainly sand consisting of quartzite with biotite (upper left), pure quartz and granitic rocks. Undispersed silica fume (SF) and suspect fly ash (FA?) occurred. The dark areas are pores in extruded perlite and air voids, and a hole in the thin section due to a lost corroded steel fiber (cf. Figure 4). with precipitates of calcium carbonate, represent- ing a local weakness zone near the perlite concrete layer. However, grey friable micro-PP fiber concrete, represented by sample Nes-3, clearly showed that also parts of the outer concrete was partly severely attacked, as shown in Figure 8. Chemical analysis of thin sections N1 and N2. Table 4 summarises the EDS analyses performed on the thin sections. Most of the analysed points and frames are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The carbonates were represented by three forms; 1) PCD in the cement paste matrix, 2) deposits on air voids in paste (“Cc” in Table 4) and within perlite and 3) very fine grained carbonation resembling ordinary carbonation due to atmospheric CO 2 . The finer carbonation was not analysed. The chemical composition of perlite glass was similar to rhyolite: In terms of oxide components (weight percent), the analysis N1-7 (Figure 7A) cor- responds to: Na 2 O = 4.08 %, K 2 O = 4.56 %, Al 2 O 3 = 13.69 %, SiO 2 = 74.63% and CaO = 3.04 %. The apparent absence of iron and magnesium is typi- cal of a source material, which represents highly differentiated late stage volcanic melts. No sulfur was detected in extruded perlite glass. N1-8 repre- sents apparent non-degraded CSH-rich paste sitting within a pore in a big perlite aggregate. Carbon and sulfur were not detected. In contrast analysis N1-5 from cement paste among PCD in presence of col- lapsed perlite, showed a very severe Ca-depletion, which is a typical feature of PCD concrete (Sibbick et al. 2003, Hagelia and Sibbick 2009). The de- pleted paste was otherwise apparently carbonated and sulfurised. The PCD compositions and calcium carbonate de- posits were not pure calcite. They were substituted by a small amount of magnesium, and were also sulfurised. Smaller amounts of alkalis, aluminium and silicium also occur, which may be chemically bound to the carbonates. The C/Ca+Mg –atomic ratio in calcite is 1. However, apart from a very low ratio of 0.33 in N1-3, the ratios in PCD and calcium carbonate deposits varied from 0.53 to 0.72 (cf. Fig- ures 5 and 6). The C/Ca+Mg–ratio in carbonate analysis N2-4 (cf. Figure 6B) was 0.53, which is very close to 0.5 in Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 . Hence PCD and the other carbonate deposits were apparently a mix- ture of calcite and calcium bicarbonate, although amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) might not be ruled out. Also N1-6 (rust) of a thick corrosion product after steel fiber apparently contained an iron-carbonate component. The thaumasite–like phases (N2-3 and N2-5), had an odd composition with unusually high carbonate contents. The Si/Al ratios were about 2 indicat- ing intergrowth of thaumasite and ettringite. The Ca/Si+Al ratios were 1.02 and 1.4 and the Ca/S ratios were 2.0 to 3.8 as opposed to thaumasite and ettringite ratios, being equal to 3 for both ratios in both minerals. The mineral resembles aspects of Ca 6 Al 3 (CO 3 ) 3 (OH) 12 · 26H 2 O (carbonate ettringite). However, in the present case Si substituted for Al and carbonate might have substituted for some of the OH groups. The silica fume lump (N2-2) had a surprisingly low Si and unexpected high Mg. SiO 2 in silica fumes are usually well above 80 wt. %, whilst the Si atomic % in Table 4 corresponds to SiO 2 = 393 Hagelia Figure 4: X-ray map of the domain shown in Figure 3. High carbon intensities within perlite and corrosion product represent the epoxy used in thin section preparation, whilst lower C intensities represent calcium carbonate.

The analysed areas and points are indicated in Figure 7, being less accurate than the thin section analyses. Sample Nes 1 of thenardite-rich white powder of completely degraded perlite concrete was analysed as bulk and in two individual grains. The bulk analysis (Nes 1a), representing an about 0.35 mm x 0.4 mm area centered on Figure 7A, showed very low Si, being much lower than the quartz content by XRD would seem to indicate. Moreover, the Na and S concentrations (7.24 and 2.60 atom %) were lower than expected for this thenardite rich mate- rial. Thus, the sample is not exactly the same as the one used for XRD, despite taken from the same small batch. However the Na/S ratio was near that of thenardite. The bulk analysis also indicated high contents of C and O, indicating presence of carbon- ate, with possible interference with the carbon tape. The point analyses of thenardite –like single crys- tals (Nes 1b and Nes 1c) showed that ratios of Na, S and O are compatible with thenardite. In contrast point analysis Nes 1c had no C despite sitting next to the former thenardite with C, suggesting that C variation is real. Minor amounts of Si, Al and Ca may represent very fine debris. Cl and Mg were absent. Sample Nes 2 representing white degraded and very friable perlite concrete was analysed in three points. Nes 2b is an acicular phase quite similar to CSH, yet with much S and Na. The Na/S ratio was higher than ordinary sodium sulfate. Nes 2c is a point analysis in fine grained material, perhaps reflecting the composition of more than one phase. Yet, the Na/S ratio was very high due to low S, sug- gesting Na is not just restricted to sodium sulfate. Nes 2d of a single grain has a Na/S ratio being compatible with thenardite. It should further be noted that Nes 2 and especially point 2c contained Cl, likely derived from de-icing salts. Mg was also detected here. Sample Nes 3 represents a small sample collected 7 from grey friable micro-PP fiber concrete. Nes 3a is a point analysis of a tiny grain, which may reflect other near by grains. The analysis is somewhat com- parable with bulk analysis of the entire frame of Fig- ure 7C (3b), reflecting a mixture of CSH-like phases and sodium sulfate. However, also in this case the high Na/S ratios suggest excess Na. Point Nes 3c reflects an outer thin deposit of Na and S bearing material with Na/S ratio similar to thenardite, sit- ting on a substrate of CSH-like material. Also 3d resembles a mixture of thenardite and CSH. The Ca/Si ratios in friable micro-PP concrete do not indicate extensive Ca-depletion. A little Cl and Mg were also present. Figure 8, which encompass Fig- ure 7D, shows that this concrete was extensively influenced by degradation in presence of sodium sulfate. The general impression of the debris samples was that sodium sulfate is omnipresent and dissem- inated within CSH-like phases. Sodium also seems to be in excess in comparison with thenardite. Sulfur isotopes Sulfur isotopes were analysed in order to put con- straints on possible sulfur sources. The thenardite- rich sample Nes-1 and sample N1 with extensive carbonation by sulfurised PCD and partly collapsed perlite within Ca-depleted cement paste matrix were selected. The relatively heaviest sulfate was detected in bulk analysis of N1 (d 34 S = +9.19 ‰), whilst sulfate in thenardite and sulfate in bulk residue of N1 after acid leaching were lighter (d 34 S = +7.44 ‰ and d 34 S = +5.73 ‰, respectively). The standard NBS 127 was run as unknown, yielding d 34 S = +21.60 ‰, which is 0.50 ‰ higher than the true value. The data allow us to calculate the iso- topic composition of sulfur in the carbonates, on the likely assumption that sulfur isotopes behaved 395 The silica fume lump (N2-2) had a surprisingly low Si and unexpected high Mg.

The Hagelia sphere (N2-23) corresponded quite well with Type C composition of brown mainly unreacted transparent glass fly ash. CaO in the analysed particle is 22.64 wt. %. Type C fly ash is not a highly pozzolanic material. Figure 6: Back scatter images of thin sections N1 and N2.

Instead they apparently represent a mixture of calcium carbonate and cal- cium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 ) and were otherwise sulfurised, substituted by Mg and also contained a little K, Na, Al and Si. Standard chemical literature states that calcium carbonate dissolves in excess of CO 2 to form calcium Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 . It is interesting that the XRD of small samples did not record a lot of calcite as opposed to what was indicated by generally elevated C and O in the SEM-data. Hence, it seems possible that these carbonates in fact may represent some form of amorphous calcium carbon- ate (ACC). In the Nes tunnel, it seems evident that bicar- bonate was present in the ground water, due to the occurrence of thermonatrite efflorescence on the rock mass. However, spalling had occurred all over the place, and was not restricted to water seep- ing through joints in the PE-foam panels. Hence we mainly need to invoke atmospheric CO 2 as the likely main source of carbonate, which when dis- solving into water forms carbonate ions when pH is much alkaline, and bicarbonate at circum-neutral pH. Nevertheless, this cannot explain why severe Ca-depletion was brought about. Indeed, such a reaction is most typically associated with influence of acidic waters, as was also suggested by the pet- Nes 2c mixed 11.07 46.36 21.58 0.68 1.38 3.76 1.52 10.35 0.28 2.34 0.68 0.00 0.00 Nes 2d Single 10.98 51.4 17.71 0.4 1.61 7.65 7.53 0.23 0.03 1.34 1.03 0.00 0.00 Nes 3a Paste 14.29 59.99 4.46 0.89 2.31 8.95 0.68 1.22 0.72 5.88 0.54 0.08 0.00 Nes 3b Bulk paste 22.66 62.00 1.81 0.54 0.56 2.03 0.20 0.36 0.22 8.83 0.19 0.60 0.00 Nes 3c mixed 17.23 55.81 8.30 1.12 0.82 2.51 4.09 0.28 0.00 9.47 0.38 0.00 0.00 Nes 3d mixed 19.28 60.44 4.27 0.63 1.45 5.61 1.43 0.64 0.39 5.73 0.00 0.12 0.00 rographic features. Origin of thenardite sulfate No report suggests significant concentrations of sul- fate in the local ground water. There is no industry in the area, and the rock mass is completely domi- nated by rhomb porphyry which has a feldspar-rich mineralogy with composition similar to latite. Most of the spalling concrete was also screened from ex- ternal water by still intact PE-foam plates. Hence, it must be concluded that the sulfate originated from the sprayed perlite concrete itself. The S isotopic data showed that thenardite sulfur must reflect two different sources. Possible sources are the gypsum added to the cement and perlite, because the concrete aggregate did not contain any sulfur bearing mineral. The heaviest sulfur was sitting in the sulfurised carbonates (calculated to d 34 S = +9.57 ‰), whilst the lightest was sitting in residue after acid leaching (d 34 S = +5.73 ‰). For comparison, previous analysis of fairly intact CSH in thaumasite bearing Norwegian sprayed concrete were ranging from d 34 S = +10.6 ‰ to d 34 S = +11.8 ‰. These concretes were made in 1987 and 1999, respectively, and their S isotopic compositions were interpreted to largely reflect gypsum added to the cements (Iden and Hagelia 2003). However, associ- ated thaumasite derived from external sulfate had Table 6: S isotopic signatures of sulfates in thenardite; bulk carbonated concrete and residue after acid leaching.

It should be noted that gypsum sources used in cement production are represented by ancient evap- orites, having distinct age- dependant S isotopic signatures. This depends on the isotopic variations in the ancient seas from which gypsum evaporated. The lightest possible S isotopic signatures of sig- nificant gypsum deposits are represented by up- permost Permian to lowermost Triassic evaporites, being d 34 S ⇡ +10-13 ‰(Claypool et al. 1980). Data from Zechstein anhydrite units in West Poland have d 34 S = +9.6 ‰to +12.6 ‰(Peryt el al. 2010). On the other hand other sources of gypsum with heavier sulfur are possible. Unpublished data of the au- thor from Norwegian cement shows that gypsum with d 34 S = +21.3 ‰has been used just after year 2000. However, there are reasons to believe that the Nes tunnel was made with cements from the same factory as our previously investigated sprayed con- cretes, being constructed at more or less the same time. Hence, it may be concluded that all of the S isotopic signatures obtained from the Nes tunnel are significantly lower than the minimum estimate for added gypsum (d 34 S ⇡ +11-12 ‰): The d 34 S compositions obtained in a) sulfurised carbonate (PCD), b) thenardite and c) the residue after acid leaching are about 2 ‰, 4 ‰and 6 ‰lighter than any possible gypsum source, respectively. All com- positions may be regarded as intermediate between two sulfur sources. It is implicit that the heavier end-member must be represented by added gyp- sum, whilst the lighter end-member clearly seems represented by sulfuric acid. The lighter sulfate source involved was bound to the less soluble phases in the Nes carbonated per- lite concrete. It is therefore quite possible that this is represented by SO 2 gas initially trapped within the pore space of extruded perlite. In the first place SO 2 must be expected to have been present in the perlite raw material, being a common volcanic gas. Moreover, during the production of extruded per- lite this gas can be trapped in the pore space if oil or coal has been used for combustion. However, for the extruded perlite used in the Nes tunnel, no chemical documentation is available. The main point here is that sulfur dioxide has a very light S isotopic composition, frequently show- ing negative d 34 S signatures (Faure 1986), and that it reacts with water to form sulfuric acid. In view of the observation that the pore space of perlite had frequently collapsed during the spraying operation (Figure 5B) this should indeed facilitate direct ac- cess to any possible aggressive gas at the earliest stage, likely before and during early setting of the cement. If so, it would seem likely that cement hydration never went well, and that portlandite perhaps never formed. This may also explain why sulfur was distributed evenly throughout the ce- ment paste matrix as seen in Figure 4. This is not at odds with the fact that the perlite glass was sul- fur free. It is, however, not possible to put further constraints on the amount of sulfuric acid involved, because we do not explicitly know whether the added gypsum sulfur was similar to Zechstein or even heavier. Reaction mechanisms The fact that thenardite (type V) and sodium sulfate (type III) occurred in the main spalling zone shows that salt crystallisation represented an important ingredient in the spalling process. It was argued above that Ca-leaching assisted by sulfuric acid de- rived from perlite, with PCD acting as a sink for liberated calcium was a prerequisite for the forma- tion of sodium sulfate. Yet, the sprayed concrete used for fire protection in the Nes tunnel had clearly been influenced by frost and also variable moisture loads in presence of de-icing salts, depending on seasonal variation. Moreover, this kind of tunnel lining is sensitive to pressure waves from traffic, be- cause the construction is pretty slim and mounted to the rock mass by bolts. The thin concrete layers outside foam panels has in fact been subjected to dynamic loads, which must have resulted in micro- cracking at an increasing rate, hence making the concrete more and more susceptible to degradation by combined freeze/thaw, salt crystallisation and dissolution. The relative humidity (RH) in Norwegian tun- nels is generally < 60 %. For this reason it is of no surprise that mirabilite was not detected, since this mineral is only stable at RH > 65 % for Norwe- gian tunnel temperatures. Until recently the conver- sion of thenardite to mirabilite has been regarded as most important for build-up of crystallisation pressure and spalling (Skalny et al 2002), owing to their great differences in molar volume (V thenardite = 53.30 cm 3 /mol versus V mirabilite = 218.56 cm 3 /mol). However, research has shown that the effects of thenardite have been underestimated. This is due to more complex phase changes, along with the significant impact from degree of supersaturation. Indeed, the growth pressure of thenardite may be about four times higher than that of mirabilite at high supersaturation. Cyclic conversion tests have demonstrated that thenardite alone can inflict con- siderable damage to rocks of different porosities (Yu and Oguchi 2013). Rodriguez-Navarro et al (2000) reported that fast evaporation due to lowering of RH conditions, leading to high supersaturation in micropores before thenardite precipitation, results in high crystallisation pressure of thenardite, whilst mirabilite crystallises at lower level of supersatura- 399 Hagelia tion generally as efflorescence. Due to the extensive presence of weak and powder-like concrete it is likely that mass trans- fer during freezing in the spalling region might be compared to mechanisms taking place within saline soils. Chuvilin et al. (1998) have demonstrated that water soluble salts such as sodium sulfate have a fundamental influence on the process of ice for- mation and the formation of cryogenic structures. They reported that the mass transfer of salt in freez- ing saline soils is a result of ion transfer within the water flux, surface conduction, diffusion and thermodiffusion; the most important process is the transfer of salt ions within the water flux. The max- imum accumulation of water corresponded to the largest accumulation of salt, hence being prone to supersaturation of thenardite. V. Conclusions The Nes road tunnel was closed for nearly three years due to extensive spalling of perlite concrete used for fire protection. The present investiga- tion has shown that the degradation process began with early stage leaching of the cement paste ma- trix, due at least in part to involvement of sulfuric acid derived from sulfur dioxide gas in the per- lite pore space. PCD and other carbonates formed a sink for Ca, which consequently made way for sodium sulfate formation with significant and re- peated salt crystallisation/dissolution events taking place within the main spalling zone. During win- ter salt scaling was acting in harmony with the freeze/thaw cycles. The effects of dynamic loads from traffic accentuated the speed of the attack.

Darquennes a , Y. Wang a , F. Benboudjema a , G. Nahas b a b LMT (ENS Cachan, CNRS, Université Paris Saclay), 94235 Cachan, France Institut de radioprotection et de sureté nucléaire, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France ⇤ aveline.darquennes@ens-cachan.fr Abstract For certain cement chemical compositions and under specific temperature and humidity conditions, concrete deterio- ration can be attributed to internal sulphate reactions. This pathology mainly affects massive structures (e.g. bridge piers, dams, nuclear power plants) or precast concrete structures that undergo specific heat treatments. Without an external sulphate source, sulphate reaction is characterized by delayed ettringite formation leading to swelling of the cementitious matrix and cracking. Nevertheless, the mechanisms and the impact of this pathology on the microscopic and structural scales are still today not thoroughly understood. A performance based approach (accelerated treatment) was recently proposed by IFSTTAR (test method n 66) in order to determine the sensitivity of a cementitious mixture to the delayed etttringite formation. It consists in longitudinal swelling measurements on cylindrical specimens submitted to drying and wet cycles followed by a water curing at 20 C. In this work, the internal sulphate reaction in a concrete specimen that has followed an accelerated treatment is monitored by means of X-ray tomography. X-ray tomography is a non-destructive test that provides information on the 3D mesostructural evolutions. Using a post-treatment method implemented in Matlab, the evolution of several parameters (porosity, cracking) is quantified. The interfacial zone between aggregate and paste matrix is also studied. Supplementary observations performed by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy confirm that the delayed ettringite is principally formed in the large pores and in the interfacial transition zone of the cementitious matrix. Finally, using a 3D numerical reconstruction method aggregates can be seperated from the cementitious matrix to create a finite element mesh of the specimen at the mesoscale level that can be used for numerical simulations. Keywords: Cracking, Delayed ettringite, Mesoscale, Porosity, X-ray tomography I. Introduction In France, the internal sulphate reaction is a rela- tively newly studied pathology - since the nineties. It is linked to the delayed ettringite formation with- out an external sulphate source. Ettringite develop- ment depends on several parameters as the cement chemical composition, the maximal temperature inside the concrete at early age and its humidity content. When temperature reaches a value supe- rior to 65 C - this is the case for massive structures as bridge piles and precast concrete - ettringite for- mation slows down, stops or dissolves (Divet et al, 1998). After concrete cooling and for an adequate moisture content in the concrete porous network, delayed ettringite can be formed inside the hard- ened concrete. Ettringite mainly appears in the large pores and in the aggregate/paste interface (To- sun, 2006). Its formation can induce high swelling pressure leading to a global matrix expansion and to its cracking. It is important also to underline the fact that the kinetics of this phenomenon is very slow. Indeed, concrete swelling can appear after several years. In order to compare the sensi- tivity of different concrete mixtures to the delayed ettringite formation, IFSTTAR developed an accel- erated method, named test method n 66 (Pavoine et al, 2006 and 2007). It consists on applying a thermal treatment at early age following by wet and drying cycles. To quantify the evolution of the delayed ettringite formation, the global expansion and the mass variation are monitored (Pavoine et al, 2006; Escadeillas et al, 2007) as also the permeabil- ity (Al Shamaa et al, 2014), the strength (Bouzabata et al, 2012), the Young’s modulus (Al Shamaa et al, 2014), and the microstructure by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) pictures (Tosun, 2006). However, the majority of these experimental tests lead to the specimen destruction. In this study, we propose to use a 3D non-destructive method, the X-ray tomography, combined with an optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe and quantify the effect of the internal suphate reaction on the microstructure. 401 Darquennes et al. Figure 1: Position of the sample for the global (a) and the local (b) scanning (top view). II. Experimental Materials In order to determine the sensitivity of a cementi- tious mixture to the delayed etttringite formation, a performance based approach (accelerated test) was proposed by IFSTTAR (test method n 66) (Pavoine et al, 2007). It consists in longitudinal deformation measurements on cylindrical specimens submitted to drying and wet cycles followed by a water curing at 20 C. In this study, the sensitivity of a Portland cement concrete with siliceous aggregates - insensi- ble to alkali-aggregate reactions - is studied using a cylindrical specimen (diameter f = 11 cm and height h = 22 cm). Its Water/Cement (W/C) ratio is equal to 0.48 and the concrete composition is given in Table 1. A thermal treatment for a period of 7 days was applied (Al Shamaa, 2012). After mixing, the speci- men was kept at 20 C during 2h. Then, the temper- ature increased until 80 C (heating velocity = 2.5 C/h) and kept constant during 3 days. Finally, the specimen was cooled until a temperature of 20 C (cooling velocity rate is equal to -1 C/h) and then it was demoulded. It was kept at 20 C and 91% of Relative Humidity (R.H.) for 334 days, and then under water. The tested specimen was 774 days old and was characterized by a linear expansion equal to 1.3%. After the X-ray tomography, it was sliced in order to analyze its microstructure. Experimental tests The effects of the internal suphate reactions on the concrete microstructure were monitored by X-ray tomography. This analysis was completed by opti- cal and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) tests. X-ray tomography During the X-ray tomography test, the concrete specimen was placed on a rotating support between the X-ray tube and the detector (Figure 1). The specimen was then crossed by X-ray beams and 2D radiographies around the rotation axis were ob- tained. Finally for each specimen a 3D image was reconstructed. The specimen dimensions control the X-ray tomography picture resolution. Indeed, a thinner specimen facilitates crossing, leading to a smaller voxel size and to a better resolution. As the specimen dimensions could not be modified, two types of scanning were applied: a local (Figure 1a) and a global (Figure 1b) one. To limit the length L1 or L2 (Figure 1) and thus to improve resolution, scanning was performed in three positions: at the top, the middle and the bottom of the specimen. The obtained picture resolution is equal to (approx- imately) 60 µm and (approximately) 30 µm for the global and local scan respectively. A 3D image of the specimen was finally numeri- cally reconstructed (Figure 2). In this image, grey- levels vary as function of the material capacity to absorb X-rays. Areas with a lower density (such as air in cracks or in pores) are characterized by a darker grey-level making thus feasible to identify the porosity and the paste matrix.

The method applied to isolate and to quantify the void volume is briefly described hereafter: • To limit the effect of artifacts related to the specimen boundary, a sub-volume (Figures 2 and 3a) is isolated inside the specimen. • To determine the grey-levels threshold separat- ing the voids from the paste matrix (segmen- tation), lines are drawn through the 2D image (Figure 4). This step is performed after each scan. • Based on the grey-level threshold separating the porosity from the paste matrix (Figure 4), the picture is segmented: white pixels corre- spond to voids and black pixels to the paste matrix (Figure 5a). grey-level threshold is identified to isolate the interface between aggregates and matrix by segmentation (Figure 8a) and the aggregates (Figure 8b). • As Figure 8b has a lot of noise and the ag- gregates are presented with white and black pixels, a further post-treatment is applied. To isolate the aggregates, the continuity of the line giving the aggregate contour is amplified and the pixels of the aggregate surface are represented with white pixels using a dilation method (Figure 9). It is important to identify the localization and the form of aggregates as the delayed ettringite seems to form preferentially in this area (Tosun, 2006). • The segmentation is applied on all 2D images by means of numerical loops (using Matlab) or on the 3D volume using a specific software (e.g. ImageJ) (Figure 5b). These two methods provided similar results (Table 2). Notice however that this method cannot be di- rectly applied to isolate aggregates. Indeed, the grey-levels corresponding to aggregates and to the cementitious matrix are very close (Figure 6). It is therefore necessary to amplify the contrast be- tween these two areas. The following procedure is applied: • To limit the artifacts related to the specimen boundary, the grey-level of the entire surface around the specimen is defined as the grey- level corresponding to the porosity (Figure 7). • The contrast between matrix and aggregates on the 2D picture is amplified (Figure 7). The Figure 4: Two linear profiles containing paste matrix and porosity: line 1 (b) and line 2 (c). 403 Darquennes et al. Figure 5: Segmented images in 2D (a) and in 3D (b). Microscopy analysis To identify the different areas (voids, interface be- tween paste and aggregate, etc.) observed on the 3D X-ray tomography images, the different specimen slices were analyzed by means of optical and scan- ning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dis- persive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The observations were performed on coarse and polished surfaces. III. Results and Discussion The main effect related to the internal sulphate reac- tions is the ettringite dissolution/recrystallisation. Moreover, the delayed ettringite located on the in- terface between aggregates and paste can generate high pressures leading to cracking. From the X-ray tomography several observations (Figure 10) can be made: • Large porosity is probably related to the ettrin- gite dissolution. • Darker areas characterize the interfacial area around the aggregates. The different areas were isolated using previously described approach. Results are detailed hereafter and the validation of the X-ray tomography observa- tions is provided by means of microscopy analyses. Porosity Based on the post-treatment of the X-ray tomogra- phy images, porosity (large pores, dissolution sites, Figure 6: Raw 2D image (a) - Two linear profiles containing paste matrix and aggregates: line 1 (b) and line 2 (c) 404 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Table 2: Porosity (%) determined with a 2D method (Matlab) and a 3D method (ImageJ).

The results obtained for the global and local scans are given in Table 2. The 2D (Matlab) and 3D (ImageJ) methods provide similar results. It appears that porosity is lower at the specimen bottom for all the tested methods (similar results were obtained by perme- ability tests). The difference between the global and local scans can be partially attributed to noise which is more important for the local scans due to the presence of matter between the X-ray source and the studied volume. Moreover the total volume is lower for the local scans. Aggregate/paste interface The X-ray tomography images indicated darker ar- eas around several aggregates (Figure 11a and 11b). The optical microscopy observations confirmed the existence of a different matrix texture around these aggregate (Figure 11c). Moreover, the large dark round marks shown in Figure 11b and 11d corre- spond to large pores covered by mineral crystals. To determine the hydration products in these areas, SEM analyses combined with EDS were ap- plied. Results show clearly the presence of delayed ettringite (Figure 12). It has a more compact mor- phology (Figures 13 and 15) and it is particularly lo- cated in vacuoles and large pores - probably formed during the dissolution stage - (Figure 14) and in the interfacial zone (Figure 13). Moreover, the interfa- cial zone is characterized by cracks (Figure 12). The delayed etttringite located in these cracks tends to occupy all the free space. All these observations confirm the X-ray tomography observations and the fact that the interfaces between paste and ag- gregate (dark lines around aggregates on the X-ray tomography images) are filled by delayed ettrin- gite. Isolating cracking located at the interfacial area around aggregates can therefore be used to quantify this product. Unfortunately however in this study the crack width is inferior to the pixel size leading to an overestimation of the delayed ettringite. IV. Conclusions The aim of this experimental campaign is to study the consequences of internal sulphate reactions on a concrete specimen using a 3D non-destructive method, the X-ray tomography: cracks, voids due to ettringite dissolution and the formation of delayed ettringite in the aggregate/paste interfaces. This last point is also confirmed by SEM observations. Aggregates are also isolated from the paste matrix and a finite element mesh of the specimen at the mesoscale level useful for finite element calculations can be created. The adopted picture resolution does not how- ever allow quantifying the aggregate/paste inter- faces despite the use of two different level scanning methods (global and local). A solution consists in limiting the dimensions of the specimen. This technique will be used in a future study on a new sample with a smaller diameter, directly after the thermal treatment and for several years.

Some common and hardy misunderstandings coexist with confusion about sample size and representativity. Statistics determines the minimum number of particles to be assessed to achieve a certain statistical error (analytical, instrumental, and operator error come in addition). This paper outlines analytical procedures as common in aggregate assessment, and makes a comparison with the metals mining industry. Keywords: petrographic assessment, particulate materials, concrete aggregate, counting statistics I. Introduction In daily concrete construction and engineering rou- tine, ‘microscopy applied to building materials’ is largely synonymous with ‘aggregate assessment’. For one, this reflects the enormous annual produc- tion volume of concrete ( ⇠ 24G tonne/annum glob- ally, or about 10km 3 ), for another, the recognition of deleterious alkali-aggregate reaction AAR as a worldwide damage mechanism (e.g. Broekmans 2012, Fernandes & Broekmans 2013). Nowadays, civic and infrastructural structures are normally designed to hold at least half a century, whereas critical and/or costly structures like coastal defense works and power installations (e.g. hydropower, nuclear) may be designed to last for two centuries or even longer, in both cases anticipating for a lim- ited amount of degradation from ‘natural decay’ as well as ‘wear and tear’ from normal use. By con- trast, distress from damages like e.g. unforeseen AAR (and disregarding calamities) cannot be antici- pated for, and strictly reduces a structure’s lifetime expectance. One strategy proven effective to minimize the chance for deleterious AAR in forthcoming struc- tures is petrographic assessment of the aggregate material, prior to mixing and emplacement of the concrete it is to be used in. Petrographic assessment thus comprises the determination of relative propor- tions in weight or volume percent of the composing lithologies (including potentially deleterious), by particle counting of a collected or submitted sample. Typically, gravel fractions are assessed macroscop- ically by manual sorting, sand fractions using a petrographic microscope in thin section. Identifica- tion of (usually fine-grained) lithologies in coarse particles may require preparation of additional thin sections, and/or supplementary methods like XRD, SEM-EDS/EPMA, or other. The analytical protocol is elaborated in the forthcoming RILEM guideline AAR 1.1 Petrographic Method (2015), bringing the preceding AAR 1 (2003) guideline up-to-date. The procedures adopted by (inter ) national standards are very similar, e.g. ASTM C295 03 (2003), BS7943 99 (1999), CUR Recommendation 89 08 (2008) (also see Jensen & Sibbick 2001). Regardless which petro- graphic standard or guideline is adhered to validate concrete aggregate, most rely primarily on litholog- ical classification and application of standardized nomenclature (see e.g. Broekmans et al 2009). The forthcoming petrographic atlas in RILEM Guideline AAR 1.2 (Fernandes et al 2015) intends to facili- tate correct identification of potentially deleterious rock species. Subsequently, relative proportions of constituent lithologies are determined by particle counting in coarse materials (followed by weigh- ing and commonly conversion to volume percent), in fine materials by point counting in thin section, typically around one thousand points (expressed in volume percent). Determination of modal contents by parti- cle/point counting is strenuous for the analyst, de- manding undiluted attention for the duration of the entire assessment, possibly while being fixed in an ergonomically less-than-optimal posture. The type of work itself is tedious, and arduous if done for prolonged time. At consultancy businesses, a typi- cal assessment including writing up observations and tabulating data takes one half day by quali- 409 Broekmans & Fernandes fied/highly educated personnel (sample/specimen preparation come in addition), and the commer- cial market price is to a large extent determined by the hours spent. To remain price-competitive, possibilities to extend assessment of a single sample to count more particles/points are strictly limited. Consequently, the size of a sample that will be as- sessed as a whole is in practice limited too. It is therefore interesting to take a closer look at the re- lationship between a one thousand particle/point assessment versus sample size. II. Pierre Gy’s Theory of Sampling - ToS The theory of sampling was devised by Pierre M. Gy in the 1970’s. Originally in French (Gy 1975), it was translated into English (Gy 1979), and has since then found pervasive acceptance and appli- cation throughout the metals mining industry, and elsewhere (see e.g. Minkkinen 2004). The Histori- cal Summary (Gy 1982, p3) quotes a statement by Weed which can be traced back to the Glossary in The Mines Handbook from (1922, p17): “Sampling. [. . . ] Honest sampling requires good judgment and practical experience.”. Referring to the latter aspect, the books by Gy elaborates extensively on rigor- ous and reliable procedures for the extraction and preparation of representative (sub ) samples. Sam- pling might seem a sinecure, but reducing a 400,000 ton iron ore port stockpile to a ⇠ 35g sample for analysis requires both suitable hardware and rigor- ous procedures (e.g. Petersen et al 2004), to arrive within 0.2wt% of the quarry sample. Far more importantly, Gy’s ToS also developed a mathematical-statistical underpinning (which was substantially extended in Gy 1992) for the minimum size of samples from solid and/or particulate ma- terials to be considered statistically representative. Thus, for truly representative samples, variation between different samples extracted from one and the same bulk parent remains within predefined limits. This intrinsically relies on repeatability of the (extraction) procedure as well as (analytical) reproducibility (Howarth 2000). As an example from real life, the port sample of a bulk batch of gold ore concentrate was found to con- tain only 19ppm Au, one-fourth of the quarry sam- ple at 72ppm (parts per million – microgram per gram). By detailed assessment using XRD, QEM- SCAN and supplementary techniques, the differ- ence could eventually be attributed to gravity segre- gation during long-distance rail transport (while ex- cluding ‘salting’ of the bulk concentrate with lower grade material). After remixing the concentrate at the port, the original Au-content was again ‘re- stored’ within analytical error (Lombard & Youlton 410 2014). The findings and conclusions in above (much excerpted and abridged) example totally relied on the undisputed representativity of the quarry sam- ple, extracted and prepared according to the princi- ples defined in the ToS. A large number of similar examples and case studies on a variety of minerals in diverse situations have been published in jour- nals and reported at conferences, and invariably arrive at the conclusion that a) sample representa- tivity according to the ToS is quintessential for a reliable result, but b) yet and despite is commonly ignored (see e.g. the January 2004 Special Issue titled “50 years of Pierre Gy’s Theory of Sampling – Proceedings of the First World Conference on Sampling and Blending etc” in the journal Chemo- metrics & Intelligent Laboratory Systems [sic!]). Unfortunately, ‘sample size and representativity’ as a concept only enjoys very limited popularity. At first glance, the mathematical background of the statistics involved uses unfamiliar notations and jargon and probably discourages most geoscientists save math-aficionados. In addition, the interactions between various aspects of sampling and sample size are intricate and not instantly clear, and mu- tual effects are complex and occasionally counter- intuitive. Even when the book by Gy (1982, 1998) are well written, the extensive deliberations and mathematical derivations still demand appreciable time to sink in and comprehend. As an author, Gy was well aware of the limited popularity of the subject of statistically correct sam- pling for analysis, a fact illustrated rather sadly in Figure 1 (also see Tkachev 2014). Nevertheless, at the end of Chapter 28, Gy concludes: “[. . . ] Sam- pling and sample preparation should be on an equal footing with assaying and given exactly the same consideration. Sampling has become a science and must be treated as such.” (Gy 1982, p350). Yet and despite, statistics is generally perceived as the dis- cipline capable of proving a given hypothesis true, but make the opposite –skillfully phrased– sound equally plausible: “There’s lies, damn lies, and statistics.”, which has been a handy marketing tool in many cases and for a long time (see e.g. Huff 1954). III. Modal assessment of solid rock materials As referred to in the introduction of Howarth (1998, p594), Delesse (1848, p379) states: “To study a rock completely, it is not sufficient to know the differ- ent minerals that compose it, one should also de- termine the proportion of each of them; the so- lution of that question presents some difficulties, that cannot be resolved directly by comparing their densities, that is to say if the rock encloses more 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 1: Popularity of ToS in practice: the book by Gy was published in 1998, and also purchased in 1998 according to the librarian’s pencil markings, but never loaned for 15 years until it was deaccessed in 2013. than two minerals.” [translation MATMB], which is followed by a procedure for the modal analy- sis of rocks considering their relative surface areas (reportedly, previous attempts on modal analysis by weight using liberated mineral grains were un- successful). It is interesting to know that the first rock thin section ever was created one year later in 1849, by metallurgist/meteoriticist Sir Henry Clifton Sorby (in: Humphries 1992). Since then, many researchers have been contributing to modal thin section analysis, notably Rosiwal (best known from his abrasion hardness scale) until ⇠ 1900 and Chayes and co-workers in the mid of the 20th cen- tury (see e.g. Howarth 2004). The comprehensive historical overview by Hykšova et al (2012) extends into stereology as used in pathology and microbiol- ogy, and sports many great names from science. The graph from Van der Plas & Tobi (1965) to judge reliability of statistical point counting data from thin section analysis has been applied widely (at the time of this writing, Google Scholar returns 470 citations for the paper), but has been shown to be inaccurate to species of interest with a very low or very high abundance (i.e. <10vol%, or >90vol%) and getting worse towards the extremes (see the discussion in e.g. Neilson and Brockman 1976). The landmark paper by Howarth (1998) demonstrates this inaccuracy through thorough mathematical- statistical analysis, and in doing so, also disproves the undeservedly popular allegation that “Perhaps 300 [counts] will suffice for most ordinary work” (ipse dixit Dryden 1931, p237). His contribution also presents to new graphs that since their publication have been widely adopted, also by RILEM AAR 1.1 (2015). While these dia- grams (i.e. Figure 2AB on p596-597) do provide cor- rect statistical errors also for low/high-abundant species, they are a bit challenging to read. They show that analytical error (= statistical uncertainty, i.e. the chance in percent that the true result is different from the one actually found) increases towards low/high extreme abundances, and in- creases towards lower overall point/particle counts. Thus, analytical error is lowest for abundances in the range 20-80vol% counted in a large popula- tion of points/particles. The remainder of this pa- per relies extensively on Howarth (1998) and the graphs therein as mentioned above, which have been adopted by RILEM AAR 1.1 (2015). IV. Grain versus particle In the mineral industry, sample representativity is totally quintessential for the correct evaluation and validation of a mineral stockpile (see example from Lombard & Youlton 2014 elaborated above), or indeed an entire deposit. In industrial rock pro- cessing, raw material is comminuted down to ap- proximately the grain size of the (metallic or non- metallic) minerals of interest, to minimize presence of non-recoverable composite particles and max- imize liberation, as only fully liberated mineral grains are useful for further processing. Imagine a platinum ore: Pt-contents are typically on the order of 2ppm and sometimes less, and the de- posit can only be operated economically profitable if most of the Pt can be recovered from the ore (see e.g. Dill 2010). Thus, the raw ore is commin- uted (first crushed, ultimately pulverized in up to five successive steps) to free all platinum-minerals from unwanted host that would impede further concentration or refinement. The mineral process- ing industry invests a lot of money in equipment to obtain a powder product consisting of individ- 411 Broekmans & Fernandes ual, mono-mineralic grains, as well as in QA/QC at multiple stages from raw material to final prod- uct. Consequently, literature describing experiences from the mineral industry regarding sample rep- resentativity and counting statistics thus refers to (liberated) ‘mineral grains’. By contrast, assessment of the AAR-potential of coarse aggregate (cf. RILEM AAR 1.1 2015) relies on lithological identification of constituent litholo- gies based upon mineral content, structure, and texture/fabric. Next, relative volume proportions are determined per lithology, essentially a modified version of the Gazzi-Dickinson method originally developed for provenance determination (see e.g. Ingersoll et al 1984, and references therein). Fi- nally, the AAR-potential of bulk aggregate material is classified according to local experience (RILEM AAR 1.1 2015). Thus, the entities counted in pet- rographic aggregate assessment comprise whole particles (whether crushed or of natural origin), as opposed to liberated individual mineral grains as in the mineral industry. Even when ‘grain’ and ‘particle’ are commonly used interchangeably, both terms are in fact not syn- onymous. The difference is not just trivial: a par- ticle may be composed of multiple mineral grains, whereas the opposite makes no sense – a single min- eral grain cannot consist of multiple particles, or else it would simply be a ‘composite particle’. Only if particle size approaches mineral grain size, then ‘particle’ becomes identical with ‘grain’, and the distinction may appear redundant. However, pet- rographic aggregate assessment is explicitly based on particle counting independent of size fraction, even when some of the particles assessed may be identical with grains. V. Routine petrographic assessment of concrete aggregate Procedures are described in detail in RILEM AAR 1.1 (2015). In brief, a representative sample of coarse aggregate shall be separated into its con- stituent lithologies by handpicking, and relative proportions are then determined by weighing (can be converted into volume fractions using specific weight). Thin sections may be prepared from indi- vidual coarse particles for identification purposes, typically of fine-grained lithologies. Representative sample sizes are given in Table 1 below, in which the specified sample weights are recalculated as numbers of granitic or arkosic cubes of the nominal size on edge, and spheres of nominal size in diame- ter respectively, to give an idea on the number of particles accessible for assessment (also see Broek- mans 2006). At 50mm and 40mm particle sizes, samples cf. RILEM AAR 1.1 (2015) are larger and 412 hence contain more particles than cf. ASTM D75- 03, whereas from 20mm down, ASTM-compliant samples tend to contain more particles. Fine aggregate is not separated, but instead as- sessed in thin section by point counting in a petro- graphic microscope. Commonly, two thin sections are prepared for the fraction 2-4mm, one single thin section for the fraction 1-2mm (optional 0.063-1mm, or alternatively one single thin section 0.063-2mm – finest material can be analyzed by XRD after addi- tional milling). The size of a standard petrographic thin section is ⇠ 26 ⇥ 48mm ( ⇠ 1” ⇥ 1 7 / 8 ”, fits stan- dard holders by many instrument manufacturers), of which ⇠ 24 ⇥ 44mm represents specimen surface (here rounded to 1000mm 2 ). The number of parti- cles that fit onto one single thin section is strictly limited by their size, and amounts to about 150 par- ticles 2-4mm, and about 600 for 1-2mm. To ensure that ‘all particles’ are involved in the assessment as well as to compensate for the ‘tomato salad prob- lem’ (term originally coined by Goldsmith 1967), the number of counts per thin section is set so as to exceed the number of particles contained, usu- ally by an arbitrary factor of ⇠ 1.5 ⇥ or thereabout – always assuring that the whole specimen area is covered. Regardless the total number of thin sections and/or points counted, statistical error remains uniquely determined by the number of particles actually assessed (in addition to abundance of ‘species of interest’). Thus, errors can be deter- mined for numbers of particles (not counts) and the observed volume percentage (abundance) of a given ‘species of interest’, using the graph in Figure 2A of Howarth (1998). The en-echelon curves define absolute errors in volume percent, which can be recalculated as relative error. For instance, an abso- lute error of 1.5vol% represents a 7.5%-relative error at 20vol% abundance, which quadruples to 30%- relative error at 5vol% abundance. At 2vol% abun- dance (as allowed for chert/flint in Dutch guideline CUR-Recommendation 98-08; similar values apply in UK and DK), 1.5vol% absolute error represents a 75%-relative error – the true abundance is some- where in the range 0.5-3.5vol%. Table 2 summarizes thus calculated relative errors, for a range of parti- cle numbers and abundances at 20-10-5vol%. Obviously, relative error is largest (64%) for low abundance (5vol%) at low particle count (150, one single thin section only). In an assessment of two thin sections 2-4mm aggregate comprising ⇠ 300 individual particles together, a species of interest at 5vol% abundance achieves a 44% relative error. Abundances of that magnitude are quite common in polymict aggregate materials, which are again widely applied in concrete. The only way to re- duce (both relative and absolute) error is to include more particles in the assessment. This is simply 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands and solely determined by the mathematical back- ground of counting statistics for which no shortcuts exist, hereunder ‘extensive operator experience’ as well as ‘petrographic wizardry’ (note: Dryden 1931, as debunked in Howarth 1998). The easiest way to resolve this is not by counting more points in available thin sections, but instead by preparing and assessing additional sections (Howarth and French 1998, p174). Table 3 tabulates the number of standard-sized (=1000mm 2 ) thin sections needed to contain a certain number of particles 2-4mm or 1- 2mm, to achieve a predefined relative error, at three selected abundances (20-10-5vol%). If a large error is acceptable (as e.g. for non-critical concrete appli- cations), then assessment of one or two thin sections is sufficient. However, the number of thin sections rapidly increases towards lower abundances and towards lower error. Thus, as an example, assess- ment of 2.0vol% chert (+flint+chalcedony+opaline silica, cf. CUR-Recommendation 89-08 2008) with 10%-relative error requires counting 15000 particles (extrapolated from Figure 2A in Howarth 1998), for 2-4mm aggregate comprising one hundred thin sections, or ‘only’ about twenty-five if for 1-2mm aggregate. While such numbers of thin sections are practically unfeasible and unrealistic, they can to a large extent be circumnavigated by additional comminution. VI. Routine assessment of a hypothetical noble metal ore Many different procedures and protocols exist, but all are essentially based on the same principles. Consider a metallic ore containing ⇠ 2ppm Au (=0.0002wt%, as determined by chemical assay), present as isolated massive rounded grains of na- tive gold of 50µm size hosted in a quartzitic matrix with grain size ⇠ 1mm and density 2.65kg · L 1 (as determined by reflected light ore microscopy on selected samples). To assess this amount with 10%- relative error (i.e. 0.0002 ± 0.00002wt%), a represen- tative sample must contain at least on the order of 10 7 (=10,000,000, i.e. ten million) individual grains of the ore, according to mathematical statistics elab- orated by Gy (1983, 1998). With ⇠ 1mm grain size, one liter of sample material contains 10 6 grains, so that a sample of at least 10L (>26.5kg) may be considered as representative. The entire sample is comminuted to liberate all the gold grains present, as well as to enable reduction into subsamples of a size better suitable for assessment while preserving representativity, i.e. maintaining total number of particles to be assessed. Subsamples are extracted from the parent bulk using rigorous procedures and suitable equipment (e.g. an automated sam- ple divider). The ultimate subsample for specimen preparation and analysis consists of a carefully pre- pared and weighed amount of fine powder, still containing 10 7 mineral grains as determined by statistics but now of finer size. After specimen preparation (see e.g. Kwitko- Ribeiro 2012), liberated mineral grains are individ- ually identified in a specially adapted SEM-EDS instrument (e.g. QEMSCAN – Quantitative Elec- tron Microscope SCAN, MLA – Mineral Liberation Analyser, now both owned by FEI), capable of ana- lyzing up to one thousand grains per second (e.g. Fandrich et al 2007, Grauch et al 2008). Using highly specialized proprietary software, minerals are iden- tified by combining signals from backscatter and EDS detectors with image analysis and grain mor- phology (e.g. Pirard and Sardini 2010), and modal proportions/abundances are determined. Uniden- tifiable grains (typically composite particles and trace minerals) are automatically recognized and kept separate for manual classification. Depending on fineness of the sample powder, one standard sized thin section may contain up to half a million of individual grains, which at one thousand grains per second, takes a mere five hundred seconds to analyze. Both the SEM instrument and the assessment process are highly automated and require mini- mal operator effort. Back in the 1970’s, the first automated mineralogy instruments relied on opti- Table 1: Minimum sample masses in kg, for particulate materials with maximum particle sizes in mm.

Thanks to ever increasing computing power (according to Moore’s Law, doubling every eighteen months), the time needed to process acquired data decreases continuously, while accuracy and resolu- tion increase (cf. the extensive review by Gu 2013; also see Gu 2003). Alternatively, certain manufac- turers offer software packages that turn an existing (newer model) SEM-EDS instrument into an auto- mated mineral analyzer. Lately, progress has been made to extend mere ‘liberated-grain counting’ to- wards ‘automated identification of lithologies’, to reconstruct rock types from drill cuttings with large variation in size and (mineral) composition (e.g. Haberlah 2012). In addition to offering the neces- sary speed, automated grain analysis significantly reduces operator error, though even an automated 8 12 16 12 16 24 16 24 32 operator must be ‘educated’. Nowadays, SEM-EDS instruments are available that are the size of an office coffee machine, almost as convenient to operate, costing roughly the same as a research-grade optical petrographic microscope. It is only a matter of time until ‘automated mineral analyzer’ software applications will be ported to such machines. VII. Summary Reliable assessment of particulate materials is gov- erned by the mathematical background of statistics. Total statistical error for a given ‘species of interest’ depends on its relative abundance in the sample, and the overall number of particles (or grains, but not points) counted, for which no shortcuts exist in terms of operator experience or magic sample treat- Table 3: Examples of minimum numbers of particles / thin sections needed, to achieve a predefined analytical error for abundance levels 20-10-5vol%. abundance [vol%] absolute error [vol%] true range [vol%] min. particles needed predefined error 50%-relative 20 ± 10.0 10.0-30.0 10 ± 5.0 5.0-15.0 5 ± 2.5 2.5-7.5 50 100 200 1 1 2 1 1 1 predefined error 20%-relative ± 4.0 16.0-24.0 20 10 ± 2.0 8.0-12.0 5 ± 1.0 4.0-6.0 350 800 1 700 3 6 12 1 2 3 predefined error 10%-relative 20 ± 2.0 18.0-22.0 10 ± 1.0 9.0-11.0 5 ± 0.5 4.5-5.5 1 500 3 200 7 000 10 22 47 3 6 12 *: number of particles per thin section: 2-4mm: ⇠ 150 / 1-2mm: ⇠ 600 ¶: extrapolated from Fig. 2A in Howarth (1998). 414 min. thin sections needed* 2-4mm 1-2mm 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands ment or analysis. It is essential to understand that the ‘grains’ referred to in literature on assessment of particulate sample materials in the mineral pro- cessing industry, in fact comprise ‘particles’ when applied in a concrete aggregate context. In certain cases (e.g. ‘chert sensu lato’ in Danish/Dutch/UK polymict aggregate), the resulting number of parti- cles to count is inevitably very large, as determined by the nature of the material to be assessed. How- ever, these numbers are small compared to the num- bers common in the metals mining industry, where fully automated instrumentation and analysis are the standard. Educating operators and ‘clientele sensu lato’ that large counts are indeed required and a worthwhile investment in structural longevity is challenging, but necessary (Holmes and Robin- son 2004). Equipment and software are evolving rapidly, supported by equally rapid developments in computing power. This offers great opportunities for automated assessment of particulate materials used in the building and construction industry in the near future.

Mendonça Filho ⇤ , José Pacheco, O ğuzhan Çopuroğlu Delft University of Technology, Materials & Environment (CiTG), Delft, The Netherlands ⇤ fernando.ni13@yahoo.com Abstract Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) is a powerful tool for research studies on building materials. Elemental quantification in cementitious phases contained in the concrete microstructure can be performed at an excellent spatial resolution. However, accurate compositional quantification requires a standard-based analysis, whereas currently the most common are standardless microanalysis. Reasons behind this approach lie on the difficulty of finding appropriate microanalysis standards in EDS studies. In standard-less analyses, elemental quantification from an EDS spectrum provides normalized quantification, i.e. an analytical total of 100%. Most EDS detectors cannot provide reliable data for elements with smaller atomic number than sodium, which results in the stoichiometric determination of oxygen. The aim of this paper is raise awareness about the importance of a controlled experimental parameters and the use of mineral standards when performing EDS analysis on cementitious materials. For this purpose, both types of investigation (with and without standards) are performed simultaneously in order to obtain chloride profiles in six reinforced mortar specimens subjected to chloride ingress and carbonation. Results illustrate that differences in element concentrations can be derived by the absence of mineral standards which could lead to inaccurate interpretations of element concentrations such as chlorine. Keywords: EDS, chloride profiles, carbonation, reinforced mortar. I. Introduction Durability of concrete structures is a serious con- cern around the globe. Reinforcement corrosion is the predominant degradation mechanism affect- ing concrete infrastructure. In normal conditions, a stable oxide layer forms at the steel surface due to concrete alkalinity. This oxide layer, also known as the passive film, is capable of preventing deteriora- tion due to reinforcement corrosion. Nonetheless, the change of local pH (carbonation) or the ingress of chloride ions result in the dissolution of this film (Hansson, 1988; Bertolini et al, 2013). Chlorides dissolved in sea water or de-icing solutions pene- trate through the concrete pore network. As they accumulate at the steel surface, the amount of chlo- ride ions needed for destroying the passive layer is known as the critical chloride content, which once reached, initiates localized reinforcement corrosion (Mehta and Monteiro, 2008; Grantham, 2011). Con- versely, the ingress of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is re- sponsible for consuming the available calcium ions (Ca + ) in the pore water and portlandite (Ca ( OH ) 2 ) in a reaction resulting in the precipitation of cal- cium carbonates (CaCO 3 ). This reaction, known as carbonation, causes a reduction in the pH of the paste (Bijen, 2003; Neville, 2011). Chloride induced reinforcement corrosion is the most common cause of corrosion degradation. In order to estimate the remaining service life of con- crete infrastructure, assessment of chloride concen- trations is usually carried out by wet chemical anal- ysis. This method is performed in layers through- out the concrete cover (chloride profiles). Then, chloride concentrations are fit to a transport model from which predictions on the time necessary for chloride concentrations to be equal to the critical chloride content is determined. As the critical con- tent indicates the start of attack in steel, most stan- dards use it as a guidance value for service life predictions, emphasizing the necessity of accurate measurements (EN 1992-1-1, 2004; fib, 2006; CUR, 2009). Further, chlorine can usually be found in the paste as a component of Friedel’s salt due to precip- itation or chemically bound to the C-S-H (Glass and Buenfeld, 2000; Reddy et al, 2002), and carbonation is known to change it between those two forms by releasing bound chlorides (Glass and Reddy, 2000). Carbonation induced corrosion is common in 417 Mendonça Filho et al. concrete infrastructure with high water/cement ra- tios and low cover thickness. The assessment of the depth of carbonation is performed by splitting concrete cores and spraying the fractured concrete surface with phenolphtalein, or more accurately by polarized light microscopy.. Visual inspections on the penetration of carbonation are possible because concrete in alkaline conditions, pH higher than 10, will be pigmented whereas carbonated concrete, pH lower than 9, will not. Usually, this carbonation in- duced corrosion proceeds at a slower rate compared to chloride induced corrosion. The rate at which the carbonation front proceeds has been studied in service life prediction models (DuraCrete, 2000; LIFECON, 2004). However, a combination of chlo- ride ingress and carbonation presents a more severe environment for reinforcement corrosion. In fact, this combination has been considered as the most common case in practice (Basheer et al., 2001). Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) is an increasingly available tool for element quantifi- cation at high spatial resolutions. Compared to WDS, EDS provides simultaneous quantification of elements present in the cement paste (Wilson et al, 2014; Krakowiak et al, 2015). The principle of micro- analysis through EDS is the possibility to infer infor- mation about the concentration of elements through the ratio K between the intensity in the number of X-ray counts of a sample and a known standard. As the interaction of the beam with the substance changes for each material, corrections must be done to take into account differences in mean atomic number, differences in absorption of X-rays and differences in the production of secondary X-rays or X-ray fluorescence (Çopuroğlu and Einarsson, 2011). Also, the detection of elements with lower atomic number than sodium is not reliable due to their poor X-ray efficiency (Newbury, 2002). There- fore, phases with chemically bound water should have the amount of oxygen determined by stoi- chiometry. A fully quantitative analysis is defined by the consideration of matrix effect corrections (among others, the most commons are ZAF and FrZ ) using specific minerals for each element and accounting for test parameters such as beam cur- rent, accelerating voltage, type of detector, take off angle and working distance (Goldstein et al, 2003; Winter, 2012). The opposite, a semi-quantitative analysis is possible because most commercial soft- ware for microanalysis possess internal standards for the most common elemental peaks, allowing internal calculations to take place in disregard of beam current and the matrix corrections mentioned. This way of analyzing EDS spectra is considered to be ‘point&shoot ’in this paper. This approach is very common among concrete researchers. The rea- son for this may lie in the complex composition and structure of hydrated cementitious materials, but it 418 Table 1: Cement composition CEM I 52.5R Oxide CaO SiO 2 Al 2 O 3 Fe 2 O 3 K 2 O Na 2 O SO 3 MgO TiO 2 Mn 3 O 4 P 2 O 5 Cl Total wt. % 63.98 19.76 4.93 3.16 0.54 0.27 3.17 1.92 0.28 0.11 0.77 0.04 98.93 is also possible that many researches are conducted without the awereness of the possibilities, since the software is typically marketed for qualitative analysis. Furthermore the greatest challenge to the cement-based materials microanalysis is the lack of proper microanalysisIdeal standards which are not widely available as e.g. rock-forming minerals or synthetic glasses. In general, chloride quantification by means of microanalysis has been published elsewhere (Mori et al. 2006; Jensen et al. 1996; Jensen et al. 1999; Jakobsen 2013; Anzalone et al. 2013; Pacheco et al. 2012; Pacheco et al. 2013). Likewise, the in- vestigation of carbonation through EDS and WDS has been reported elsewhere (Hidalgo et al, 2008; Groves et al, 1990; Groves et al, 1991; Lange et al, 1996; Chen et al, 2008; Liu et al, 2010; Pacheco and Copuroglu, 2015). This paper examines the differences between using semi and fully quantitative microanalysis within the framework of corrosion of reinforcement on cementitious materials. For this purpose, mi- croanalytical results obtained from ‘point&shoot ’settings in the EDS spectra analyses (semi) and standarised (fully) X-ray spectra are presented. Car- bonation is interesting in particular for this context, since the presence of precipitated carbonates (CO 3 ) could cause discrepancies in the stoichiometric cal- culations. Reinforced mortar specimens were fabri- cated and exposed to chloride penetration. Half of those specimens were later exposed to accelerated carbonation in order to study the possible influence of a combined degradation system, i.e. the release of bound chlorides. Attention is paid to the cal- culations of element concentrations made by the ‘automatic ’and standard-based analyses and how it affects the measurements and its own variability. 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands II. Sample preparation Materials Mortar cylinders with water/cement ratio of 0.45 were cast with ordinary Portland cement (CEM I 52,5 R). The chemical composition of the used Portland cement is shown in Table 1. The specimens contained standard sand (CEN-NORMSAND DIN EN 196-1) with a maximum aggregate size of 4 mm and tap water. Fabrication of mortar specimens Six mortar cylinders of 24 mm of diameter per 35 mm of height, each containing a steel bar with 70 mm in length and 8 mm in width were fabricated. After casting, the cylinders were contained with plastic and kept in laboratory conditions for 24 hours, then de-moulded and stored in 20 C, >90% RH (fog) room for 28 days. Chloride ingress and carbonation After curing, the specimens were partially im- mersed in a 3.5wt.% sodium chloride (NaCl) so- lution for 60 days in laboratory conditions (22 C, 65% RH). During this period the solution was con- stantly renewed so the concentration would be kept constant. Then half of the specimens (Cl samples) were prepared for EDS analysis while the remaining specimens were subject to accelerated carbonation for 14 days (Cl + CO 2 ). The accelerated carbonation environment was set to 3% CO 2 and 75% relative humidity. Subsequently, the specimens were pre- pared for EDS analysis. Specimen preparation for microanalysis From each set of specimens two slices were sawn with an anhydrous cutting lubricant (transversal samples) and one was obtained by the Brazilian splitting test (longitudinal samples). The transver- sal samples had diameter of 24 mm with a depth of 6 mm and the longitudinal samples had a geometry of 24 x 24 x 6 mm. From these samples, polished sections were prepared. Surface polishing involved grinding with #320, #500, #800 and #1200 grinding papers; followed by 6 µm, 3 µm, 1 µm and 0.25 µm diamond paste polishing. The specimen surfaces were cleaned by immersing them in ultrasonic bath with laboratory graded ethanol for 10s between each grinding and polishing step. EDS microanalysis For the microanalysis and electron imaging a Philips XL30 environmental electron microscope equipped with EDAX energy dispersive spectrom- eter (EDS) was used under hi-vacuum chamber condition. EDS detector was a SUTW (sapphire) type with a calibrated resolution of 131.2eV at 15kV accelerating voltage. The take-off angle was 35.3 and a working distance of 10 mm. The polished specimens to be analyzed were carbon coated in a Leica EM CED030 carbon evaporator at a thickness of 10 nm. A stable beam current of approximately 0.5 nA was regularly measured by means of a pico- ammeter and a Faraday cup. Under these con- ditions, a stable beam current aimed at a quartz crystal read around 2500 cps (counts per second) at 25% dead time. The X-ray collection time was set to 100 live-sec. per analysis. Before and after each spot analysis, the average beam current was measured and included into the ZAF quantification. The approximate size of the interaction volume was reproduced by a Monte Carlo simulation. A square of approximately 5 µm by size is the field in which the trajectory of electrons is estimated, covering approximately 2 x 3 x 3 µm 3 , as simulated Table 2: Mineral standards used in DTSA-ii R Software against oxides provided by automatic settings Semi quantitative Fully quantitative Element Default oxides Mineral Composition Na Na 2 O Albite NaAlSi 3 O 8 Mg MgO Diopside MgCaSi 2 O 6 Al Al 2 O 3 Sanidine KAlSi 3 O 8 Si SiO 2 Quartz SiO 2 P Not detected nor quantified Apatite Ca 5 ( PO 4 ) 3 F S SO 3 Anhydrite CaSO 4 K K 2 O Biotite K ( Mg, Fe ) 3 AlSi 3 O 10 ( OH ) 2 Ca CaO Calcite CaCO 3 Ti Not detected nor quantified Rutile TiO 2 Mn Not detected nor quantified Willemite ( Zn, Mn ) 2 SiO 4 Fe Fe 2 O 3 Hæmatite Fe 2 O 3 ⇤ Cl Cl 2 O Scapolite ( Na, Ca ) 4 [ Al 3 Si 9 O 2 4 ] Cl * Note: Cl 2 O is a gas at room temperature. 419 Mendonça Filho et al.

It was chosen to perform the measurements in C-S-H points due to its binding capacity and abundance through the hydrated matrix with respect to chlorides. The analyses were carried out in three manners as follows (shown in Figure 1): (a) Three lines were taken in each transversal sam- ple. Each line had EDS spectra collected at every 500 µm from the specimen surface to- wards the rebar; (b) Three lines were taken in the Cl longitudinal sample. Each line had measurements at ev- ery 1000 µm from one extreme to the other (crossing the rebar previous position); (c) One line was taken in the Cl+CO 2 longitudinal sample. The line had measurements at every 500 µm from one extreme to the other (crossing the rebar previous position). For displaying puroses, averaging of chlorine con- centrations of points collected at similar distances from the reinforcement was carried out. The same procedure was performed on the longitudinal anal- yses. The procedure for element quantification was as follows: first, an EDS spectrum was collected from the mortar sample. Then, the raw spectrum was saved for full quantitative analysis. Full quantita- tive analyses were processed in DTSA-ii Software using both stoichiometry and oxygen by difference methods. Afterwards, semi quantitative analyses were performed by the native EDS software (EDAX Pheonix) from which normalised results were ob- tained under automatic settings. Table 2 presents the predetermined standards in the automatic set- tings of the EDS software. In parallel, minerals employed for fully quantitative analysis are pre- sented. Apart for scapolite, the rest of minerals were present in a commercial mineral standard mount (ASTIMEX MINM25-53) III. Figure 2 shows Si/Ca atomic ratios plotted against Al/Ca for all obtained spectra in order to confirm the phases studied. Winter (2012) states that a per- fectly pure paste of clinker and water would have values of Si/Ca ratio for C-S-H between 0.45 and 0.55 and Al/Ca ratio of 0.04 and 0.08. As the re- search was conducted with CEM I, it is accepted that a small amount of fine limestone was added, which broadens the range of results. The transver- sal samples presented results within the expected boundaries, represented by the red lines in Figure 3. In contrast, longitudinal samples displayed a lower Si/Ca ratio in a number of points, most of them from the Cl+CO 2 sample. Figure 2: Atomic ratios of spectra taken for analysis. 420 Results 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands Figure 3: Averaged weight percentage of chlorine in the interaction volume found with respect to transversal specimen depth. The red vertical line represents the position of the steel bar. Figure 3 and Figure 4 presents the concentration of chlorine by weight percentage in the interac- tion volume. A lower amount of chlorides can be observed at the outer edges of the specimens, nor- mally associated with loss by drying process. Con- sidering the longitudinal samples, it is observed an increasing trend from the surface to the vicin- ity of steel, this is in opposition with the common belief that concentrations are maximum near the surface and decrease with increasing depth. This could be an indication that once chloride ions reach the reinforcement, a cumulative process start and local concentrations surpass the ones in materials surface. While maintaining the general behavior, the Cl+CO 2 samples seems to increase the error between standard and standardless analysis. profile values for analysis with standards do not change much between Cl and Cl+ CO 2 results, on the other hand, values without standard show con- siderable difference, which can be an indication of error in the detection. The influence of carbonation will be further discussed on the discussion section. It is possible to perceive an underestimation of chloride content from standardless measurements with respect to the ones using standard minerals. This difference is not constant and even presents few exceptions where higher concentration values are found. However, it also shows an tendency against safety, since smaller values lead to inaccu- rate assumptions of remaining time for service life predictions. For transversal samples, the trend of increasing concentration from surface to steel is only present in Cl samples, while the Cl+ CO 2 samples present drops in both extremes. It is also noticeable that 421 Mendonça Filho et al. Figure 4: Averaged weight percentage of chlorine in the interaction volume found with respect to longitudinal specimen depth. The red vertical line represents the position of the steel bar. IV. Discussion Atomic ratios Most of the spectra taken displayed a similar range of atomic ratios, nonetheless it is noticeable that the transversal samples possessed a higher Si/Ca ratio. Longitudinal samples had a decreasing Si/Ca ratio in the points collected on the interface zone. It might seem counter intuitive that similar spec- imens present diferent atomic ratios for the same experiment, but the data collected from transver- sal samples never reached the interface with the reinforcement, while for longitudinal samples, the focus was on that specifically. Initially the discrep- ancies were atributed to the possible wall effect near the steel, which causes a higher w/c ratio that leads to increased formation of CH. In Hu et al (2014), a higher amount of CH was one of the main reasons to the presence of inclusions in C-S-H gel, which diminished the Si/Ca ratio. However, the research observed a stronger relation of this phenomenum for smaller w/c ratios (e. g. 0.32), thus not as likely 422 to this study. Rather, it was reported in Koleva et al (2007) that the presence of chloride ions, and in particular corrosion, could change chemical composition of hydration products, causing a shift in Si/Ca ratios of C-S-H into values similar to the ones reported hereby. Although the ratios on both researches are very similar, there is no straight forward ex- planation of how the microstructure of the gel is influenced by the presence of chlorides to increase the amount of calcium. Yet, this is evident in the longitudinal samples near the interface with the steel. Possibly, the presence of Cl- ions can attract enough Ca+ to reproduce the conditions observed in Hu et al (2007), creating a more propitious envi- ronment for a calcium rich C-S-H intermixture. An explanation for the higher number of points in Cl+ CO2 group is provided below. Effect of carbonation As most of the analysis presenting lower Si/Ca ra- tio were from Cl+ CO2 group, this can be used as 15 th Euroseminar on Microscopy Applied to Building Materials • 17-19 June 2015 • Delft, The Netherlands an indication that carbonation attacked portlandite throught the specimen, providing additional free Ca for the intermixture phases in C-S-H, the rea- son for it to be evident only in the steel interface zone probably is that just one of these effects is not sufficient to change the microstructure of calcium silicate hydrate. Nonetheless, the combination of the effect of carbonation with the presence of chlo- ride ions should be enough. It is interesting to point out that this is an opposite behaviour to the observed in Sevelsted and Skibsted (2015), where the C-S-H studied did not contained chloride ions, reinfocement or the overall cement products, which allowed carbonation to be a more straight forward process. It is also pointed out the lack in literature concerning simultaneous effect of different degra- dation processes in Si/Ca ratios of concrete. One other important mechanism of carbonation is the diminishing of the capacity of the paste in binding the chlorides ions, since it represents a difference in corrosion resistance to any given struc- ture (Lin et al, 2010; Li and Shao, 2014). Since EDS analysis take into account any chlorine in the inter- action volume (bound or free), this process should take place mainly in the surface of the specimens, as drops in chloride contents caused by loss during drying. Conversely, the drop in chlorine due car- bonation is only observed in standardless analysis, which will be discussed next. Use of standards vs standardless analysis As C-S-H is both, hydrated and porous, it presents a challenge for elemental quantification, and the high presence of hydrogen and oxygen intensify the mis- calculations in a standardless analysis because the provided analytical total of 100%. Such mistake can be avoided by the adoption of a standard based protocol that takes into account the factors men- tioned previously and allows stoichiometric deter- mination of elements with smaller atomic number than sodium. Figures 3 and 4 show a concentration around 5% in weitgh of interaction volume for all measures taken using standard based analysis, but varying chloride contents from 1% to 5% in the standardless analysis. It is very unlikely that the values near 1% are correct since the solution used presented a much higher concentration and enough time was provided to penetration. Further, since all other analysis have a convergent result, it points to inaccuracy of standardless analysis. The under- esimation of chlorine is most probable due to the choice of default peaks considering oxides that do not properly represent C-S-H phases composition and bulk structure. For longitudinal samples (Figure 4), a high error between standard-based and standradless analy- sis is seen, and it also show a slight increase in errors from chloride treated samples to chloride and carbonation treated samples. The clear under- estimation in standardless analysis (up to 90%) is of utmost importance, since service life prediction is greatly dependent of accurate chloride concen- tration determination (Frederiksen, 2009; Marke- set, 2009), which can lead to vast underrating of a structure true state. The increase in error for the samples subjected to carbonation is most likely due to the inclusion of carbon and oxygen atoms, since these elements can not be reliably measured by the probe, therefore, appearing to present lower con- centrations. Which is another point of concern, as real structures are often subjected to carbonation and chloride rich environments simultaneously and forensic examination are usually carried regardless of it. For transversal samples (Figure 3), the diference in accuracy between the use of standards or not isn’t as evident as the one mentioned above. This only reinforces the random nature of standardless analysis in the sense that non controled factors (e.g. ZAF corrections) can or not be a big influence in the results. Comparing the data regarding carbonation, one can notice that for analysis with standard min- erals the values of concentration keep somewhat constant, which is is agreement with what as previ- ously discussed. For analysis with default software peaks, the concentrations show a decrease through- out the entire depth of the specimen when carbon- ated, pointing again to a increase in error generated by the presence of additional oxygen carbon atoms. Although also present in the longitudinal specimen, this phenomenum is harder to observe in them be- cause of the already big diference between standard based and standardless analysis. V. Conclusion Results were used to illustrate differences in ele- ment concentrations that can be derived by the ab- sence of microanalysis standards, which could lead to inaccurate interpretations of concentration peaks for different elements such as chlorine. By the end of the work, it is was considered evident the impor- tance of using standardds for microanalysis. It was further discussed the influence of positionning of analysis within samples. Although it seemed to not be a major parameter regarding the acquisition of chloride profiles, the results using default software peaks showed major differences in concentrations for different orientation of analysis, reinforcing the conclusion above. It is expected that this will be a step forward for the use of standard-based mi- croanalysis in the future of cementitious phases research. Additionaly, the influence of carbonation was ob- served. While it seemed to not be a key parameter 423 Mendonça Filho et al. for determination of chloride content, it played a useful role in pointing out a weakness of standard- less analysis. Concerning the atomic ratio, it was concluded that in opposition to what was reported before, it appears that might not be the presence of chlorides, but rather the presence of chlorides near the reinforcement that changes chemical com- position of C-S-H decreasing the Si/Ca ratio. The effects of carbonation seem to assist this effect, but it is still not clear. As this work is part of an on- going research, further investigation will be carried out.
